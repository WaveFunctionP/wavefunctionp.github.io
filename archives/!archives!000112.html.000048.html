        <h3 class="title">Tweaking Site Layout</h3>
        <p>I've been messing around with the site layout in my never ending quest for perfection. Some of you (and by that, I mean most of you) are running IE in one of it's various versions. Despite careful plodding to the contrary, I couldn't coax it into display a "fixed" CSS element. So the little "Powered by ...Copyright" bar is displaying below the banner instead of floating fixedly on the bottom of the page. It's a limitation of IE the best I can tell. As this is a standards compliant (usually) web page, one might be quick to shun any user that complains about problems displaying the page. But I look at it this way: It just one more reason you should be running <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. It's free and you'll get the full benefit of knowing that your not perpetuating a software monopoly. Not to mention, see this site the way it was intended.</p>
        <p>I don't usually shun any one software solution over the other, but in this case I have to make an exception. I used to be an entrenched IE user. I really loved it. It was easy to use and a snap to extend with plugins. It didn't have that whole funky UI feel as it was designed by MS, so the experience was what I had become accostomed to. I've tried to use other browsers. I've used Opera, but after not even the first month I found myself going back to good old IE. I even tried Mozilla ealier only to get the same results: a less thatn optimal browsing experience. Fast forward to the 1.0 release of Mozilla. I read about the new release and decided to give it another go. Needless to say the "experiment" is still going. I just found myself using it contantly instead of me forcing myself to use it. I was drawn to it, especially after I discovered the new skin that came with it. I look back at IE now and wonder how I used such an old and bloated browser for so long. Just looking at the thing makes me cringe. I dread using the few apps that require IE as the default browser or engine to display web content. So, there you have itgo get Mozilla, if you can, download it, love it, worship it...</p>
        <p>Enough of the Mozilla plug, the reason I have the new footer is that I wanted to provided links to "document compliance" sites, but not display those funcky gifs they provided. I tend to favor text anyway. I never liked those flashy pics that didn't seem to fit in. Besides I'm no good at editing pictures, as I have no sense of aethetics. So the word is, as usual, if you want to get the most from this site. Go get a standards compliant browser, and see just how much better your internet surfing experience can be.</p>
        <p>This will be increasingly important as I start to add more DOM complant javascripting services on this site. Who knows maybe I'll make a Mozilla sidebar as an extra incentive.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at December 23, 2002 09:01 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=112" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
