        <h3 class="title">Evercrack</h3>
        <p>I've recently discovered <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">Everquest.</a> I know it's been out forever, but I've never played it or even seen someone who played it. Well, needless to say, I've developed an addiction. A very welcome one at that, as now I don't have to spend countless hours on the net scouring for some bit of needless news to satisfy my boredom. I don't expect I'll stop posting here, but the frequency will probably fade maybe about 2 or 3 times a week. So ever little halfway interesting news item won't be posted now. I'll only be posting the things I really have something to say about and that which is I find very interesting. Till then, I can be found on EQ, Vazelle, as Athenu or Aeriwen, my lovely level 5 Barbarian Figher and level 16 wood Elf Druid, respectively. Yes, it's totally nerdy, but definitely fun. Evercrack indeed!</p>

        <h3 class="title">Gamers have New Appreciation For MMORPGs</h3>
        <p>I've spent my share playing online with a few of the online RPGs on the market. Most recently with Anarchy Online. Which by the way has an excellent story line despite rather boring gameplay. Reading up on the history was for me more fun than actually playing the game. Especially when I first started. I had to stop playing because I no longer had DSL, or any broadband offerings in my area, besides a non-coshure 2-way satellite setup that won't work well with online games. But that's not what this post is about.</p>
        <p>Online games have an addictive quality about them. All too often, players don't have the time to build up player stats or build an arsenal of items for those character to use. A quick perusal of eBay will give way to a <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&query=diablo+2+soj&cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&ht=1&from=R10&currdisp=2&itemtimedisp=1&st=2&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&BasicSearch=">plethora of offerings</a> for sale. That's no news, but perhaps if I told you that the sales being made weren't that of the material world, but only benefit the buyer by offering their virtual character on one of the many MMORPGs available. There's a lucrative, well maybe not lucrative, market for players willing to sell characters, objects, currency, or "power-leveling" services for a fee. Stranger things are often sold on eBay, but <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2003/1/6/222558/0630">here's a guy</a> who proposes and claims to make a living off of offering these services on eBay. He says it's not for the faint of heart, nor for those that don't like sitting for hours on end. He even goes on to offer some strategies for the best possible experience for those that are interested in a gaming occupation.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Apple Making Headlines...With Me At Least</h3>
        <p>Steve Job's keynote at the MacWorldExpo has been creating <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1041978831.html">quite a stir</a>. <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0301/07.powerbooks.php">Lust inspiring laptops</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">better browsers</a> and a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/07/1920248">slew of software</a> being released for the Mac. Now I'm firmly in the PC camp, but sometimes, especially as of late, I doubt my non-Unix upbringing. Apple's marketing campaign has begun to thoroughly work it's way into my head. I have to say that I've been thoroughly tempted into at least trying a Mac. Now I know what you are saying. "It's a phase; it will pass". I know, but they're so cute. When I saw the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>, I immediately began to regret buying my Nomad Jukebox. But that's no big deal. The problem is that I keep coming across <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">Mac only applications</a>, that I really wish I could use. Top that with the fact that I'm just sick and tired of fiddling with every aspect of the PC. Using the PC is a chore, and one that I'm finding myself having a harder and harder time justifying.</p>
        <p>The grass is almost always greener on the other side. Yes, I've used that argument too. To no great effect I might add. It seem every time I turn around I'm bombarded by "bad design". I'm not only talking about the technology in PCs, but aesthetics, maybe I'm getting soft, but I'd like an app to look as well as it performs. It even seems as if the latter is getting harder to find also. No one seems to be taking the time and effort the is need to ensure their product is finished before they release it. From my experience, when something attains a cult like following it at least warrants a passing glance. I too often find myself staring instead. I've been seduced by the Mac community. Given time I'm sure that I'll buy one. Most likely when I go looking for college lifestyle functionality. That will not be any time soon unless I secure a surplus of funds.Still, that 12" <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Powerbook</a> looks sweet. Until that time I can only look on as a spectator....a dreadfully envious spectator.</p>

        <h3 class="title">A Level-headed Look at Microsoft</h3>
        <p>Microsoft has been through a lot during the past few years. Legal battles, questionable security initiatives (Palladium), and confusing software platforms (.Net) have all served to drag the company to new lows. Many claim the eventual demise of the juggernaut and still otherwise. What's going on at Redmond? Kuro5hin has an <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2003/1/2/153157/7696">interview with Adam Barr</a>, a former Microsoft developer who seems to have levelheaded view at to what has happened. It's hard to get truth when it comes to Microsoft simple because most of the most outspoken are either adamantly against or for the software giant.<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          Many people consider Microsoft to be this all-powerful entity that always gets its way and succeeds in whatever it attempts (whether through technical ability, luck, marketing, or illegal means). But in fact, if you look back at all the initiatives Microsoft has attempted, most of them have failed. Remember Windows at Work, an attempt to unify all office machines on a network? Or TrueImage, a clone of the PostScript page description language? Or ACE, the Advanced Computing Environment, designed to replace the Intel PC architecture? If you look at all the things that Microsoft has boldly announced with a gaggle of industry partners, the success rate is maybe 10 to 20 percent. So pick any ten things that Microsoft is attempting now: Auto PC, cell phone operating system, set-top box, Xbox, electronic books, Internet Gaming Zone, Tablet PC, Pocket PC, speech recognition, MSN. The odds are that only one or two of those will actually succeed.<br />
        </blockquote>The last time I read anything that wasn't biased with ridicule or praise was <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/auletta/home.html"><i>World War 3.0</i> by Ken Auletta</a>. The book was written before the antitrust trails were over and explains the mentality going on at Microsoft and enlightens the viewer on some of the details of the battle. It's a good read for any who want to know more than is put out by the media and open-source community.
        <p></p>
        <p>My view: Simply put, I believe that Microsoft is a vicious competitor. Do I believe that the actions it has taken to compete are unfair? Yes, but I don't think that it came from specific management strategies, but more from a mentality to compete. From what I read Microsoft breeds a brutal competitive atmosphere and allows too much independence to it's various departments. Overly zealous employees work hard to compete with a small guy fights giant mentality and hasn't quite gotten the picture that's they're no longer the small guy. Perhaps Microsoft is just <u>too good</u> a competitor and needs to let it's enemies catch up. Microsoft needs to realize that, even though it is a very unstable market were a good idea can overtake a giant's, it still can't afford to act like it's playing catch up and act like the leader it is.</p>
        <p>Yes, I still <i>want to</i> believe in Microsoft.</p>
        <p>P.S. I have to agree with Mr. Barr, Linux is still too much tech for the average Joe. Linux on the desktop will never see widespread use until developers start working to a better experience. It can't be just as good, it has to be a better experience for users to switch.(costs aside)</p>

        <h3 class="title">AmphetaDesk SideBar</h3>
        <p>I've been trying in vein to find a adequate news program for windows. There are a few on the market, but few utilize a 3 pane design with a simple interface. Well, that is 'till I found <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">AmphetaDesk</a>. I've used it before, but because it didn't use the requisite 3 window panes, I left in alone to find another solution. I did like AmphetaDesk for it's simplicity and light weight. After a few weeks of using <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">NewzCrawler</a>, I slowly began to dislike many of is quirks and especially that I was going to have to pay for it come a few days. It really didn't justify the cost in my mind.</p>
        <p>Fast Forward to yesterday. I reloaded AmphetaDesk and found out you could customize the templates used to generate the headlines page. I've also been hearing a lot of noise on the net about Mozilla sidebars. Couple that with a little JavaScript and viola, 3 pane (sorta) RSS newsreader mozilla sidebar. <a href="/pics/amdesk.jpg">[screenshot]</a> It's a bad pic, but you get the idea.</p>
        <p>The core idea is to use AmphetaDesk to aggregate the feeds, along with it's feed management features, modify the index template to fit in a sidebar and add some collapsible menus to the feed list. Tweak and you've got a totally free, easy to use, way to read news feeds.</p>
        <p>All you need to get it running is to <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/index.html">download and install</a> AmphetaDesk, copy this <a href="/files/index.txt">index file</a> to your template folder(right click, save target as, rename to index.html), and <a href="javascript:window.sidebar.addPanel%20('AmphetaDesk',%20'http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html','')">install the side bar</a>. (The last link is a javascript that installs the AmphetaDesk URI: "http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html", to your sidebar)</p>
        <p>Note. I've removed the excerpt/description container from the perl script because the list was too long for my tastes. If you want it just copy the appropriate container from the default template to the new one.</p>
        <p>Remember to back up your default template (rename it, or copy it to another directory) before you over write it with the new template. It really doesn't matter, because you should have the zip file you downloaded that you can restore from, but it might save you some trouble if you've already made some changes to the template that you want to save.</p>
        <p>All page formatting is done in DOM, so in other words the sidebar is just a webpage. CSS and scripting all apply the same as if it were in the main window. So, CSS is how I chose to apply style. target="_content" in the "a" tags makes the links display in the main window instead of the side bar. Sidebar information can be <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/catalog/web-developer/sidebar/">found here</a> and an AmphetaDesk template <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/skinning.html">explanation is here</a>. (Don't know perl? Neither do I, all you need to know is all variables start with "$", other than that you'll catch on pretty quick)</p>
        <p>Enough of this noise, have fun. Remember to tell me what you think, any suggestions?</p>

I've only made it through the PC list, but I'd have to agree with them by most accounts. A great place to check out some of the best games this year has produced.

        <p>I can't recommend Warcraft III or Mafia enough as they provided many hours of excellent gameplay for me.</p>

        <h3 class="title">The Web now has a Voice</h3>
        <p>In perhaps one of the most <a href="http://www.earstudio.com/projects/listeningPost.html">disturbing</a> things I've ever heard, you can hear the voice of the web. But really it's more than that; the site collects conversations on various forums and chat rooms and combines them statisticly to produce a spoken soundscape. It uses different pitches and tones to mark new topics and indicate general traffic intensity.</p>
        <p>The following from the web site:<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          What does the collective voice of the internet sound like? Countless others are with you when you browse the web, some reading the same words at the same time, and yet you have no way of sensing their presence. Listening Post gives voice to this vast, silent world, transforming collective online activity and communication into a multi-layered sound installation. This uniquely designed space monitors thousands of online exchanges in real time, revealing the patterns and rhythms of people communicating with each other.<br />
        </blockquote>The result it quite unnerving in my opinion. It made me real uneasy to listen to it, but it probably had something to do with the way they chose the voice and sound patterns. I couldn't connect to the Bell Labs site at the moment. (It's been /.ed) Nevertheless, I'm a changed man after hearing it. I don't think I'll ever get it out of my head.
        <p></p>
        <p>But don't let that stop you from checking it out. Maybe I just caught it at the wrong moment. (I'm not sure if it changes or if it is just an example.) I need a drink....</p>

        <h3 class="title">Using MoveableType with DHTML Javascript</h3>
        <p>As if you didn't know, <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">MoveableType</a> is the BOMB! Well, OK, maybe not that good. But it's what I use for my blog engine and it makes things much easier. As with most blog software that uses the BloogerAPI; it uses a template system to generate the webpage and manage content. Allowing you to focus on your sites news and articles instead of formatting each and every page. MoveableTypes system uses a proprietary system a little different than most. I like to think that it's a little bit easier to use and more flexible. The only problem is getting to know tag system and how it works. Using this system is really easy once you know the lingo, but how do you use the DHTML script to get that ubercool navigation bar?</p>
        <p>Here it is in all it's glory.<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          &lt;MTCategories&gt;
          <p></p>
          <p>&lt;div id="cat&lt;$MTCategoryID$&gt;"&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;div class="sidetitle"&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;a href="javascript:catList('cat&lt;$MTCategoryID$&gt;')"&gt;[+]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="&lt;MTCategoryArchiveLink&gt;"&gt;&lt;$MTCategoryLabel$&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;div class="catlist"&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;div class="side"&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;MTEntries lastn="5"&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;a href="&lt;$MTEntryLink$&gt;"&gt;&lt;$MTEntryTitle$&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/MTEntries&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/MTCategories&gt;<br /></p>
        </blockquote><br />
        Lovely isn't it. It probably provides a little more perspective on why I wrote the script the way I did. Notice the catlist class selector. That selector is the one that gets created in memory when the script loads. It doesn't reside in my CSS file. "Side" and "Sidetitle" are selectors in my CSS file. They actually control the style even when the script isn't running, provided your browser supports CSS. The granularity built in to this sytem makes for a very general way to control the visibilty of you sheet without recoding everytime you add or delete categories or otherwise change your navbar. Also of note is the way "catlist" holds the same value of the javascript perimeter allowing the script to find the correct "catlist" to hide or show.
        <p></p>
        <p>Nevertheless, this will display all your categories you have in your blog along with the last 5 entries in each. Well, that's about it for MT tags. Enjoy your new navigation bar.</p>

        <h3 class="title">DHTML via Javascript - A Collapsable Text Menu Tutorial</h3>
        <p>I've been trying to provide as much functionality to this site without making things too complicated for the user. As you can see the navigation bar on the main page has been updated. Clicking the "[+]" will expand the category now. I didn't like the long list of recent articles running down the page, but I wanted to provide a way to get a quick look at the various topics. Let me know what you think.</p>
        <p>Now you know what I've been doing for the past couple of days. That's right, I learned to program Javascript. I've never written a program before three days ago. It was hell, but I fully intend to make your's no where as hard as it was for me. Given the plethora of programming centric sites out there, you would think that it would be a simple deal to learn. At the very least, you should be able to get a few clear examples. And in fact you can, if you want to create useless programs that do nothing. The problem is that most sites either assume that you already now how to program in another language or that you know nothing about it. The latter being the worst because they want to walk you through that process step by step while you write junk programs meanwhile totally skirting the real concepts that you need to know.</p>
        <p>We won't do that here. If you're interested we'll delve right in.</p>
        <p>Writing a program is all about moving and changing objects. it's really simple and frustrating at the same time once you realize that fact. Other places you will read about object oriented programming and how it's like "the way" to program. Well yeah it is, but for a beginner, you will mostly need to concern your self with much lower level objects. I won't do the standard "what is an object" talk, but I will tell you it's all about the API. That is Application Programming Interface. I'll be doing most of the grunt work here and indeed most every program nowadays.</p>
        <p>For clarification, we'll only be talking about Javascript this time around. Why Javascript? Because it the easiest lang. that I've found yet. (And the most widespread for its use in DHTML and other web technologies) The most important thing you will need to know before you can begin is a few resources:</p>
        <p><a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/">Netscape DevEdge</a> - Good reference and documentation site.<br />
        <a href="http://www.w3c.org/DOM/">W3C DOM</a> - The W3C's Document Object Model Specification. It explains all the types and inheritance and interface properties.</p>
        <p>You have to do lots of research to understand what each of the DHTM interfaces do and how to use them. This is crucial to understanding what you are moving around inside the containers. But with out further ado, here is the full script used to control the navigation bar.<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          function catList(id){<br />
          a="+";<br />
          b="-";<br />
          i=document.getElementById(id);<br />
          dval=i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display;<br />
          t=i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(0).getElementsByTagName("a").item(0).firstChild;<br />
          if (dval=="block") {<br />
          dval="none";<br />
          t.nodeValue=t.nodeValue.replace(b,a);<br />
          }<br />
          else {<br />
          dval="block";<br />
          t.nodeValue=t.nodeValue.replace(a,b);<br />
          }<br />
          i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display=dval;<br />
          }<br />
          if (document.getElementById && document.createTextNode){<br />
          document.write('&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.catlist {display:none;}&lt;/style&gt;')<br />
          }<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        Purdy ain't it! I still can't believe I spent about 40 hours on this alone. Good thing is, it's reusable otherwise I would have to shoot myself.
        <p></p>
        <p>I only used W3C DOM specification interfaces to the script should work with any DOM2 browser. IE 5.5 and Netscape 4 qualify for most funtions and Mozilla is fuly qualified. Note:My implementation does not qualify as XHTML. I've used the tag to insert the Category name to provide a unique id for each instance. It doesn't qualify because the names have spaces and CSS id specification doesn't allow spaces in the id. I'll have to find a work around, but this will do for now. You can alternatively use a manual naming format. UPDATE: Although at this time the validation site is down, it should now validate. Dummy me, I forgot about the tag. It's numeric and provided the unique identifier that was needed. I'll post the code in a separate article. It's pretty nifty.</p>
        <p>Let the picking begin; starting with the top:<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          function catList(id){<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "function" - we use this to establish a command to call from the web page, i.e. from a link or button.<br />
        "catList" - This is the name of the function, I could have named it catNip for that matter.<br />
        "(id)" - This is part of the "catList" function. "id" is a variable used to transfer a value to an internal function. (See below) I use this to specify the collection of tags that I want to modify. On the navigation bar it's the category name.<br />
        Of course this is were those other tutorials come in handy, syntax. We need a bracket "{" to contain the function. Otherwise you get *gasp* a syntax error. (Whatever shall we do?)<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          a="+";<br />
          b="-";<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "a" - is a variable the equal (=) sign assigns the right hand value to the left hand side. Notice I wrote that before I used it in an expression later. Variables must be declared before they are used. "+" is going to be one of the characters is replace via a later expression.<br />
        "b" - the other value that I replace with "a".<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          i=document.getElementById(id);<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "i" - another variable that I use to transfer the contents to another container.<br />
        "document" - Hey, it one of the those interfaces in our API defined by the DOM. This container performs a generic operation. It finds and returns the current page in the browser window as an object. We use any function or parameter that can be access by the "document" interface. (See what I mean by research. Check out the W3C site for more information.)<br />
        "getElementById" - Finds and returns all tags (elements) with the #id matching our parameter "id". No quotes in () because this is a variable being specified. This one was specified earlier in the "function" parameter. You can use any text value for the function which is not always true as we sill see later.<br />
        ";" - used to delaminate the end of a line. More of that syntax stuff.<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          dval=i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display;<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "dval" - variable to hold the value for our CSS style being defined.<br />
        "i" - used to limit the expression to the contents of the specified ID.<br />
        "getElementsByTagName("div")" - another contained used to filter by a certain tag, in this case the "div" tag. This container returns a list of tags, not just a generic object.<br />
        "div" - The HTML tag to filter for.<br />
        "item(1)" - Index value to filer for in the list. Note: counting starts with 0 so in this case we will return the second tag in the list, by specifying "1".<br />
        "style" - Command used to perform a style definition on the object (tag).<br />
        "display" - type of styling that we want to do on this tag. This could be any CSS style definition.<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          t=i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(0).getElementsByTagName("a").item(0).firstChild;<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "t" - Varible need I say more.<br />
        "i" - You should know what this is by now.<br />
        "getElementsByTagName("div")" - See how easy this is.<br />
        "item(0)" - Return the first "div" tag.<br />
        "getElementsByTagName("a") - Return a list of "a" tags.<br />
        "item(0)" - Return first "a" tag.<br />
        "firstChild" - DOM interface return the first object matching our criteria. (Later it is defied by either the "+" or "-" in the varibles "a" or "b".)<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          if (dval=="block") {<br />
          dval="none";<br />
          t.nodeValue=t.nodeValue.replace(b,a);<br />
          }<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "if" - conditional statement that executes the contents only if the parameters are "true".<br />
        "(dval=="block")" - Parameter that returns true if the variable dval and "block" are equal. The "==" delaminate a true or false statement if both sides are equal.<br />
        "dval="none"" - sets the value of dval to "none" if this container is executed.<br />
        "t" - Umm, yeah....<br />
        "nodeValue" - returns the value as text instead of an [object]. Allows us to evaluate and execute the rest of the string.<br />
        "replace" - replaces the text per the parameters specified. This were we actually use those values for "a" and "b".<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          else {<br />
          dval="block";<br />
          t.nodeValue=t.nodeValue.replace(a,b);<br />
          }<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "else" - executes if no other conditiond have be met. This statement sets the value of dval to "block". It also replaces the text of "a" with "b".<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display=dval;<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display=dval;" - Recursive statement. It makes a loop.<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          if (document.getElementById && document.createTextNode){<br />
          document.write('&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.catlist {display:none;}&lt;/style&gt;')<br />
          }<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        Simply, this writes a style sheet in memory, to allow for a more responsive click. "catlist" is an CSS class selector specified in my webpage. It defaults the value of display to "none"; hiding the menu by default. Added side effect is if the script doesn't execute for whatever reason, the display will NOT hide the contents of the class. Therefore the category menu will always show the entries if the script is not run, a neat side effect for those older browsers.
        <p></p>
        <p>So lets look at the whole script. You click the hyperlink, the script looks at the document, finds the CSS id specified by the text in the hyperlink via the "id" variable, finds the second "div" tag, then sets the CSS display value for that CSS ID selector and sets it to hide or show the contents of the "catlist" class selector.<br />
        At the same time, it finds the document, the CSS id specified, the first "div" tag therein, the first "a" tag, the first character, and replaces the "+" sign with "-".</p>
        <p>So, there you have it. Copy it, paste it, do whatever you like. Fell free to *gasp* change it.</p>
        <p>I hope that was a bit more refreshing than the "other" programming tutorials on the web. If you still are having problems remember look in the documentation. The information there is much more useful and free of bloated oversimplified examples. Make sure you watch your syntax, watch for inheritance problems (if it doesn't explicitly say you can do something, most likely you can't without substantial reworking), and don't forget declare your variables before you use them.<br /></p>

        <h3 class="title">Web Freedom and Geek Synergy</h3>
        <p>Geeks are a different breed. It always seems as if everything we do is bent on taking power away from structure and to the individual. This is the power behind the blogging fad. P2P technologies are on the rise and promise a new era of digital freedom. One question: where the money?</p>
        <p>As the article <a href="http://salon.com/tech/col/rose/2002/12/13/supernova/index.html">suggests</a>, the "suits" obviously don't like this sort of model as it severely cuts profit potential when you can't control the supply, the conterpart to demand. Somehow out of all this decentralisation comes a new model of profit potential and it's one that, suprisingly enough, aimed squarly at the geek or individual. The profits are marginal, but everyone gets to share instead of a select few.</p>
        <p>Conversely, what happens when a "geek" does have a large profit potential. Sell out, or stick to your guns. Wired has <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/google_pr.html">an article</a> about Google rise to fame. As the key holder to the web, Google has a lot responsibility on their shoulders. Just what will happen when Google goes public. Could they possibly maintain their policy of "no evil" when share holders have different opinions as to just what "evil" means. Just how long can Google maintain a favorable opinion by it's users, whilest minimizing a legal battle against it's policys as more and more see it as a public utility. Google has done a good job so far, but some see Google's compromise to the DCMA, China government, and Scientology as a sign of cracks in the armor that is Google's trademark geeky values. I, for one, hope for the best for Google. I just wish people would just let technology be. People can be pretty ugly when trying to manipulate the system for personal gain. Some people just can't see a good thing when it's staring them in the face. But I guess that's just the humanist in me welling up; down boy.</p>

        <h3 class="title">The Crystal Ball</h3>
        <p>Now here's a true revolutionary. <a title="ZDNet: Tech Update: Enterprise Hardware / The future of computer interfaces" href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2901050,00.html">Gartner</a>, once again make useless predictions about the future of computing. I swear, why do they even bother? Do people find this information useful. I mean it's not even bold, it's just, well...boring. No revolutionary claims, no bold statements to distinguish it from the pack of other conservatives like themselves. Where's the vision, man.</p>
        <p>I have a few disagreements I'd like to point out. (1) Ok, so the CRT is on the way out the door; no brainer there. Also, people have been touting speak synthesis for, like um, forever. I don't see it being used in any copacity other that what it is used for now: the disabled. Does anyone out there care to have there spam read out loud with some fake computerized voice while driving down the road? I know I don't. However I do see electronic paper taking off once it become available. The prediction that computers are going to assume an obiquitous role in our daily lives is hardly a new statement.<br />
        (2) The concept of a digital avatar metephor API for personalized computing is far from new. I can go to Yahoo or Amazon to demonstrate that. I do agree that speech and handwriting reconition will greatly improve. However, I don't think that we will be still using the keyboard and mouse as a primary interface. There is just too much research on other input methods. I'm not too sure when we'll have Brain-Machine interfaces, but I don't think that they are to far off considering the success of current research into the technology and the soon to come nanotech revolution. Yes, it will be a revolution, but thats another post altogether.<br />
        (3) I pretty much agree on the third prediction though it's rather obvious. It where we've been moving ever since the internet exposed a need for better data management and querying (preferably) against a personal profile of information (avatar, once again). Standarization will "hopefully" improve a lot of things in the computing realm.</p>
        <p>So, there you go. Now all there's left to do is check back here in a few years and see if my all too vague critisms hold up.</p>

        <p>I posted previously about wearable computers and obiquitous computers, but I've found a few other articles on the web to further expand on that subject. <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/mithril/index.html">This one</a> here from the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT media</a> lab with schematics and other paraphernalia to build your own Linux powered <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/index.html">wearable computer</a>.

        <p>Most of you know that I'm an avid MIT fan, but they seem to be the only university consistently making news, next to USC and, occasionally CalTech. I never meant for this site to be an MIT propanda machine, but they seem to be the only institution in the news these days. Or at least the only one releasing press reports.</p>

        <h3 class="title">And You Thought Ubiquitous Computing Was Dead</h3>
        <p>Anyone reading computer news about 2 years ago was bound to have read something about "ubiquitous computing" or "pervasive computing". I can't say that I was sad to stop hearing about it in the news. It was everywhere; everyone was so excited about it and what it was going to do for computers. A new paradigm they said. Well, finally, after many months, the fad faded away and settled into mediocrity. A bygone era of naive optimism.</p>
        <p>I'm supposed to be wearing an internet enabled pair of shoes right now, and my jacket lining is supposed to be a display. Were did it all go? What happened, surely this wasn't just another hopeless expression of geek-so-shiek technolust. Did everything have to go with the dot-com bust?</p>
        <p>Most assuredly not! It simply faded into the background where it was supposed to be in the first place. Slowly and quietly web services were rolled out to facilitate everyday functions such as news reading (XML::RDF::RSS). Along with a whole slew of other Web API's to facilitate application integration with the web and further contribute to the ideal that is the semantic web. The hardware is slowly becoming portable, powerful, and efficient enough to allow better integration.</p>
        <p>But where does that leave us? Why haven't we seen more of this technology? It leaves us right where we are right now. Obiquitous computing never promised sexy new gadgets or technologies. Cut though all the hype that was so prevalent and you see a new picture. One where you don't see computers and yet they still work for you. One that doesn't require a BS degree in computer science to operate. That was the promise.</p>
        <p>With that said; I don't think we have arrived, but we have indeed started the journey. We have much to learn on the way. But the infrastructure is being built. Wireless networks (wLAN), via 802.11, are become more common even in daily life. We'll soon have "personal area networks" (PAN), via bluetooth, and with that we have constant connectivity.</p>
        <p>The final piece of the puzzle is the software which will enable all the technologies to be useful. Such as the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/wo_Rheingold120402.asp">software</a> that this guy is working on. Social networks are the most valuable resource for people and with some innovation and perseverance; maybe well have something that truly expands and enriches our lives. Only time will tell, but something tells me; <a href="http://www.unfinishedrevolution.com/">Michael Dertouzos</a>, who spear headed the <a href="http://www.oxygen.lcs.mit.edu/">Oxygen</a> Project, would be proud.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Argument for free market bandwidth alocation</h3>Forbes is running a piece on bandwidth concerns and the absurdity of the problem. The quote pretty much sums up the problem.<br />
        <br />
        <blockquote>
          The military's stance strikes many radio engineers as silly. While the FCC can stop Americans from transmitting on certain frequencies at home, it can't control what happens overseas, where wars tend to be fought. The spectrum most of the world will use for next-generation cell phones, for instance, is spectrum the military insists on keeping to itself in the U.S.
        </blockquote><br />
        <br />
        The problem is that most of the spectum is not being used and that which is being sold at artificially exorbant prices. Coupled that with the fact that no one "owns" a spectrum, and so how can someone claim to have a right to a certain spectrum. Obviously, the most adamant detractors are those that didn't even pay a dime for their part of the spectrum. A TV media mogul in the article even has the audacity to claim that it's a right for someone to make money of being lucky, or that somehow his broadcasting rights somehow came out of "hard work".<br />
        <br />
        Yes, I'm sure you worked really hard to obtain a right to a free (public domain) airwave spectrum.<br />
        <br />
        This pisses me off. maybe I should just stop reading cause lately everything has been making upset. I need to just go hide in a closet, then maybe, I won't have such a problem.

        <h3 class="title">Classic Gaming</h3>
        <p>I was browsing the web, and came up on a site that had an intro theme like that of an old Atari game. It reminded me of how much I miss those simple games, as most games today are quite complicated. Sometimes you just need to get back to the <a title="ClassicGaming - A Member of The GameSpy Network" href="http://www.classicgaming.com/">basics</a> to really appreciate things. So, now I can't wait 'till I get the Atari 2600 emulator downloaded so I can play Frogger and Journey, among many other great classics.</p>
        <p>Update: I found a few sites for you Atari 2600 freaks out there. These were the best I've found.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.emulator-zone.com/">The Emulator Zone</a><br />
        <a href="http://www.atariage.com/index.html">AtariAge</a></p>
        <p>This is by no means a complete list, obviously. But I'm rather picky, so I only go to some the more reputable sites. But, you can do what you like. I just found no need to go to any other sites after I found these. Google will turn up plenty of results.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for an emulator and are using a modern operating system, the best one (by far) for the 2600 is <a href="http://www.emuunlim.com/stellax/">StellaX</a>. The others had a lot of problems with the sound. I tried to download it from their site, but it seems that SourceForge is experiencing technical difficulties, but luckily a quick glance at the latest version number and a google query turned up <a href="http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/a2600/stella.html">this</a>. Which is how I found The Emulator Zone.</p>
        <p>You can download ROMs at AtariAge, they have some of them available prebundled in a zip file, so you don't have to download each one that you want individually, since they are only 4K in size. Most of the classics are included in the files, along with more obscure titles. And if the prepackaged zips don't have the game you want. Don't frett, they should have it available on it's own. Along with packaging scans and cartridge photos no less! (These guys do it right!) The list of missing titles from their archives is only like 8 entries long. That's pretty impressive considering how many titles were published for that system. See now, I've taken most all the legwork out of it. Happy gaming ; )</p>

        <p>For all you Math moguls out there, now you have no reason not to be able to model you experiment due to lack of processing power. <a title="gridMathematica: Combines the Power of Mathematica with Modern Computing Clusters and Grids" href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/gridmathematica/">gridMathematica</a> is a software solution for disributed computing and/or clusters.

        <h3 class="title">Stephen Wolfram</h3>
        <p>More news along the same lines as my previous post. This one's about Stephen Wolfram<br />
        <br /></p>
        <p></p>
        <blockquote>
          <a title="Wired 10.06: The Man Who Cracked The Code to Everything ..." href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.06/wolfram.html">Wired 10.06: The Man Who Cracked The Code to Everything ...</a><br />
          <br />
          <p></p>
          <p>What happened to Stephen Wolfram in the interim has become sort of an urban legend in the scientific community. Not long after our dinner, which occurred in the spring of 1992, he became, in his own words, a "recluse." He moved, with the woman he had recently married (a mathematician), to the Chicago area and started a family. He rarely made the two-hour drive to Wolfram Research, his thriving software company. Instead, he put himself in a kind of voluntary house arrest, single-mindedly devoted to the completion of the book. "He dropped totally out of the scene in every sense of the word," says his friend Terrence Sejnowski, a neuroscientist at the Salk Institute. "He hasn't published a word, he doesn't go to meetings. He's in a self-made isolation center." To maximize his concentration, Wolfram became nocturnal: He worked at night, when the world was asleep, and retired at 8 in the morning.</p>
        </blockquote><br />
        <br />
        <p></p>
        <p>He he...kinda sounds like me. I don't think I'll be reinventing the standard interpretion of physics anytime soon though.</p>

        <h3 class="title">And now, the human race will be even dumber.</h3>
        <p>The DoE has anounced the contruction of a pair of new supercomputers that will be (theoretically) as <a title="Wired News: This Is Your Computer on Brains" href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,56459,00.html">powerfull as the human brain</a>! That is, in terms of number of calculations. IBM expects it to be completed in 2003, for a measley $290 billion. It's kind of hard to believe that my future children will enter into a world where computers are undisputably more powerful than humans, AI concerns aside. We still have a long way to go untill we see any sort of inteligence come from this hardware. If it's even possible. I gues I need to do around and finally finish reading, "The Imperor's New Mind" by Roger Penrose before making too many speculations. But hey, it wouldn't be ant fun to not make any guesses about this kind of stuff.</p>
        <p>Again, <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/">"The Singularity"</a> approches. Or, err, something like that. ; )</p>

        <h3 class="title">Top Sytle Pro 3 Review</h3>Well, I promised it to you and, finally, after long debate and many revisions, I present my <a title="TopStyle Pro HTML Editor, CSS Editor, XHTML Editor for Windows" href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">TopStyle Pro HTML Editor, CSS Editor, XHTML Editor for Windows</a> review. For those wondering, Top style provides a intuitive interface and handy tools to validate and clean up what would otherwise be very tedious and time consuming work.<br />
        <br />
        This is just the first of the original content that I plan to provide on this stie. My plans include much more. To include: detailed reviews, witty essays, and powerful editorials. Along with my daily web commentary, and insiteful news post. Provided I have the time of course. This is just a hobby for me after all.<br />
        I found <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">Top Style Pro 3</a> from a need to edit my CSS files, but what I found was so much more. I can't say adaquately how much I love this program. Enthusiasm aside, let's dig in.<br />
        No really, what is TS. Feature list is as follows, ripped right from the web site:<br />
        <br />
        <blockquote>
          HTML and XHTML editing - TopStyle comes into its own as a powerful HTML and XHTML editor!<br />
          Style Upgrade - Upgrade your HTML documents by replacing outdated markup with equivalent styling. Convert all of your font tags to CSS with a single click!<br />
          HTML Tidy - Validate and reformat your HTML with TopStyle's new HTML Tidy integration. Includes a Tidy configuration that converts your HTML to XHTML with no effort!<br />
          Editor Hyperlinking - TopStyle Pro 3.0's unique hyperlinking greatly simplifies navigating between documents.<br />
          Full Screen Preview - Display your HTML or CSS documents in a full screen preview which can be split between Internet Explorer and Mozilla (Netscape Gecko).<br />
          Related Styles - See at a glance which styles are related to the current HTML tag or CSS selector.<br />
          File Explorer - Easily navigate your local files and network connections, and create links with simple drag-and-drop actions.<br />
          Clip Library - Store your favorite code snippets in a central location for reuse.<br />
          Thumbnail viewer - See all images in a specific folder with the new image thumbnail viewer.<br />
          Custom Keyboard Sets - Create sets of custom keyboard shortcuts that insert your favorite tags or other snippets.<br />
          Custom Palettes - Create new color palettes by importing existing palettes from Macromedia Fireworks, JASC PaintShop Pro, Adobe PhotoShop (ACT format) and HomeSite.<br />
          Harmonious Colors - Create pleasing color schemes for your style sheets and HTML documents with the new harmonious colors feature.<br />
          TopStyle Blog - a blog ("web log") is built into TopStyle Pro 3.0, providing daily links of interest to web authors.<br />
          CSE HTML Validator Pro Integration - Users of CSE HTML Validator Pro can now access its HTML syntax checking from within TopStyle.<br />
          <br />
        </blockquote>Heewwww! man, thats a mouth full. So whats that saying. It's saying, that if you prefer to edit you html and css manually and generally use WYSIWYG editors for basic layout only; this it the product for you. It even support most scripts.<br />
        <br />
        Where TS shines most is CSS editing. You use a separtate "selector box" to choose your selectors, ID's and elements. You can use a simple integrated interface or, if you like, you can organize you tools by use of a dock system. Those of you that are familiar with Photoshop or Dreamweaver, will feel right at home. And, yes, you can easily switch and save dock layouts by a simple layout selector.<br />
        <br />
        TS is not for the faint of heart, it has a pretty intense learning curve. It's nowhere near that of Photoshop, Dreamweaver and the like though. I found that it took me about full 6 hours of work to where I was comforable and had everything how I wanted.<br />
        <br />
        Also of note is the preview panels. They are up dated after every change, so no switching back and forth between modes to see what the finished product will look like. Also, I mentioned earlier that TS will check you code for errors. Well, first thing you'll want to do is; decide what all will you want it to check for. It'll show compatibility alerts and error for a seemingly endless list of browsers and standards, from Netscape 3.0 to CSS 2.0, not to mention even provide solutions for and reasons behind the errors and warnings. And simplely clicking on the error/warning will automatically select the apropriate tag or ID.<br />
        <br />
        Color management is a snap. With a simple palette selector that link to the same color elements. For instance, if to choose to change the color of my text that have been formatted to "black", simplely select "black" and goto the color chooser and change to another color. Say "Red", now all the elements on my page that are the "black" will be change to "red". Simple as that! No more repetitious cutting and pasting, and no more need for macros or "find and replace". Smooth as butta!<br />
        <br />
        With all that said, I have 2 gripes. First is this package would be absolutely wonderful if it had an FTP client intergrated. That is a sore point to an otherwise top notch program. (They allow a plugin to an external ftp client, but that's no substitute in my opinion.) Second is price, 50 bucks is still a little steep for such a specialized program, no matter how good. I'm so cheap, I'm still using the <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/download/index.asp">demo</a> and dread the day when the demo runs out, as I'm morally (and legally as well) obligated to buy it when it expires.<br />
        <br />
        TS is excellent, and I whole-heartedly recommend this product to anyone who doesn't mind editing text, prefer to do so, and want completely clean code for there web pages.

        <h3 class="title">Spam filtering - Napster style!</h3>
        <p>If you're like me, your probably getting more spam than legit email. I get about 400 spam messages a day through my Yahoo! account alone.</p>
        <p>Well, thanks to a simple Outlook plugin, SpamNet, you can enjoy a nearly spamfree inbox. I just installed it today and it has already stopped nearly 300 spam messages from reaching my inbox.</p>
        <p>It simply checks your mail as it's being downloaded and checks a network of human edited lists of known spam. If the network says it's spam, it sends it to a separate folder that can be checked periodicly to insure that legitimate emails are not "listed". It's really easy to use, and runs in the back ground. If you still get spam in your inbox, simply click the spam button and it's moves the message to your spam folder and notifies SpamNet of the new spam message, so it will get filtered for other users. Likewise, you can do the reverse if you find a legitimate email in the spam folder.</p>
        <p>I'm getting about 90% accuracy, and none of my legit emails have been filtered. It's great! It's only for Outlook users though, but hopefully they will provide support for other clients soon. Get it <a title="cloudmark: home" href="http://www.cloudmark.com/">here</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="title">IM bliss soon to come...maybe</h3>The state of instant messaging (IM) on the internet looks to get a lot better soon.<a title="WG Review: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (xmpp)" href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/ietf-announce/Current/msg20416.html">WG Review: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (xmpp)</a> is a working group proposed to formulate a standard IM interface.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-964317.html">Headlines</a> as follows:<br />
        <br />
        <blockquote>
          The Internet's governing technical body quietly gave its stamp of approval Thursday to a group intent on creating an open standard for instant messaging. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the group that sets the technical standards for the Internet, gave the go-ahead to the creators of open-source instant-messaging application Jabber to create a working group based on that technology. These such groups plan the specific implementations of the technologies that make up the Internet.
        </blockquote><br />
        <br />
        Anyone who has used IM before knows just how frustrating it is to use. Current implementations all use proprietary protocols to comunicate. Talking to your friends on different networks at the same time requires you to have multiple clients open at the same time. I use <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a> to combine the big four(Y!, AIM, ICQ, MSN) different clients in to one application. But that's just a "work around" to a bigger problem.<br />
        <br />
        AOL has planned to add interoperablilty between ICQ and AIM on their next release. (AOL owns both so that makes sense anyway.) Also, IBM and Microsoft have been working on their own using SIMPLE.<br />
        <br />
        Good things seem to be in the air. I just hope common sense provails and these people start working with each other.

        <p>Let me try this again. I'm still losing my work to VB errors, but there's nothing I can do until Blogger fixes their code. Excepting perhaps copying my work before I post.</p>
        <p>I read an article from <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=00065FEA-DAEA-1D80-90FB809EC5880000">Scientific America</a> (courtesy Ars Technica) about a cybernetic money of all things. This brings all manner of thougjts into my head. Not the least of which is what something like this would do to my fragging ability. I'm pretty sure this would put me into the uber-L33t class.</p>
        <p>It also reminds my of some stuff I read by <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/">Raymond Kurzweil</a> about "spiritual machines", brain-machine interfaces and other futuristic concepts. It's interesting to think of a day when human communication trancends to level where we can communicate whole ideas and concepts instead of beating around the bush with words and mathematics like we do now. Sorry for those of you that subscribe to the <i>Star Trek</i> "Federation" future, but I find certain aspects of "The Borg" much more appealing. Were's my nightvision enhanced eye implant...</p>
