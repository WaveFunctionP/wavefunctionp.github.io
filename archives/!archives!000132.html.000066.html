        <h3 class="title">Speed Of Gravity Measured...Surprise!, Einstein Was Right</h3>
        <p>Hey, what news! Einstein was right. Scientists have measured the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993232">speed of gravity</a> using the movement of Jupiter into the lightpath of a quasar. By knowing the mass of Jupiter, corrections were taken into account for the bending of light that should occur and observing the movement of light as Jupiter passed in front of the quasar. As Jupiter's gravity bent the light as it passed, measurements were made to check the speed that the gravity influenced the light passing nearby. Final numbers came to about 95% of the speed of light with an error of 25%, so it was fairly accurate. This confirms Einstein's prediction in General Relativity that gravity propagates at the same rate as light and further fueling the speculation that gravity is akin to light in a very fundamental way. Hello, supersymmetry.</p>
        <p>I wish I knew what they were talking about when the say it disproves many newer theories the involve many dimensions. Superstring theory, in all it's various flavors, is probably included on that list. Supposedly, gravity could "shortcut" it's way through space utilizing these extra dimensions, but I assume it's just a pretty mathematics. Some kind of numerical voodoo that had nothing to do with physical observations. But such is the case without declining budgets given to physics departments nowadays. Only time will tell what effect that will have on economic development here in the US. Enough ranting, this is a great development.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at January 8, 2003 07:03 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=132" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
