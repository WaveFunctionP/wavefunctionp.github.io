        <h3 class="title">Cloned Baby Born</h3>
        <p>I find it interesting that one the first things that is mentioned about the supposed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/science/27CLON.html">cloned baby</a> is that a "religious sect" is the one responible. Could they possibly be more rude. When a Baptist or Muslim is mentioned in the news they aren't referred to as a "sect". They are given their due respect and referred by their affiliation. Not slandered by refusing to call them by their chosen name.</p>
        <p>Then there's the fact that people seem to find it more interesting to note that religion's beliefs as if to imply that it is ludicrus to believe as they do. Now I don't subscribe to this religions beliefs, but it seems to me that many people hold a equally unplausable beliefs:</p>
        <p>The belief some people hold that human life shouldn't be cloned. Same for anyone that argues that stem cell research shouldn't be allowed because it's unethical. Who are they to say when life is sacred and when it's not. When a cell is a cell or when it's something more. Just because something developes into a human, doesn't mean that before it gets to that point it should be subject to human rights. Or should it? I'm a reductionist so I have a hard time seeing the difference between a advanced chemical reaction and life at that level.</p>
        <p>For that matter, if we want to take that reasoning (that a human embryo in more than just another cell) to it's logical conclusion it's seems to me that then we would be surrounded by bigots. After all, surgery and many medical treatments (tumors) all involve killing cells, in a fully developed human being no less. How is that different. Why can you do one, but not the other. I don't see how someone can firmy hold to their beliefs just because they "believe" the to be true. Even when presented with an obvious contradiction.</p>
        <p>Just because an embryo *might* develope into a person, somehow that justifies banning useful research. Why is it that genetic research is fine if it's for exclusively for medical purposes, but not alright for me to say what color hair my child should have. We are on the brink surpassing biological evolution, but the one thing that allows us it contemplate it, is the same thing that keeps us from using for reasons of morality? Come on people, our intelligence got us here and dropped the blueprints to our very existence right on our lap. Why we can't use it? It's absurd.</p>
        <p>The day the human race realizes that we are a enormously complicated system of molecules that has developed a superiority complex; the sooner when can move on to a more productive existence. The sooner that we find a more acceptable understanding of complexity and chaos, the sooner we begin to understand our true condition. One might say that life wasn't unique or what would be the value of human life if you believe that we're nothing more than a pile of atoms. The value comes from the complexity, it's what makes each and everyone of us unique. Like many complex system the finished product is more than what is put in. So in that sense each person would still be valuable; not just a lump of talking carbon. But it is kind of funny to look at it that way. Go on try it next time you see someone, you'll see what I mean by the result is more than the sum. A most powerful and undeniably hillarious example. Humanistic ethics are still intact, just slightly....altered.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at December 27, 2002 01:39 PM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=119" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>

        <p>'sect' is the correct word. Within Roman Catholicism there are many sects, and each of the Protestant sects are, well, sects...</p>
        <p>(skt)<br />
        n.</p>
        <p>1. A group of people forming a distinct unit within a larger group by virtue of certain refinements or distinctions of belief or practice.<br />
        2. A religious body, especially one that has separated from a larger denomination.<br />
        3. A faction united by common interests or beliefs.</p>

        <p>The rude word would have been the more precise 'cult'.</p><span class="comments-post">Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;garym&#64;who&#46;net">mrG</a> on December 27, 2002 09:24 PM</span>

        <p>The real news will come later: In agricultural cloning, our best attempts fail completely in 95% of the pregnancies, and the successful births carry a 10% rate of birth defects. I won't prejudge, but considering their history of sensitivity to others, I am very interested to see if the Ra&euml;lians will indeed care for any deformed or otherwise handicapped results in their quest for science...</p>

        <p>I've always equated the word sect with cult. Not to imply that they have the same meaning, but they are often used interchangably. I've always felt that sect was a rude way to approach a rather sensitive subject. I really meant to say that it is more proper to refer to the Raelians by their name.</p>
        <p>My experience with the word may not be the same as others, but each word conjures up certain emotions despite their explicit meaning.</p>
        <p>EX: Nigger - African American</p>
        <p>Before the flames start, note the destinct emotional impact. They mean nearly the same thing, but the intent is starkly contrasted.</p>
        <p>I wonder if anything will come out the announcment or if the clone was all just a hoax. If the baby does indeed prove to be a stable clone, it'd be ineresting to know how they did it. Or if they were just extremely lucky. I guess we'll know in a week.</p><span class="comments-post">Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;derfuehrer&#64;mctphysics&#46;com">Der Fuehrer</a> on December 28, 2002 09:44 AM</span>
