        <h3 class="title">Speed Of Gravity Measured...Surprise!, Einstein Was Right</h3>
        <p>Hey, what news! Einstein was right. Scientists have measured the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993232">speed of gravity</a> using the movement of Jupiter into the lightpath of a quasar. By knowing the mass of Jupiter, corrections were taken into account for the bending of light that should occur and observing the movement of light as Jupiter passed in front of the quasar. As Jupiter's gravity bent the light as it passed, measurements were made to check the speed that the gravity influenced the light passing nearby. Final numbers came to about 95% of the speed of light with an error of 25%, so it was fairly accurate. This confirms Einstein's prediction in General Relativity that gravity propagates at the same rate as light and further fueling the speculation that gravity is akin to light in a very fundamental way. Hello, supersymmetry.</p>
        <p>I wish I knew what they were talking about when the say it disproves many newer theories the involve many dimensions. Superstring theory, in all it's various flavors, is probably included on that list. Supposedly, gravity could "shortcut" it's way through space utilizing these extra dimensions, but I assume it's just a pretty mathematics. Some kind of numerical voodoo that had nothing to do with physical observations. But such is the case without declining budgets given to physics departments nowadays. Only time will tell what effect that will have on economic development here in the US. Enough ranting, this is a great development.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Unified Theory Exposed!!! Return of the Ether</h3>
        <p>It's nice to know that these guy's have got it all figured out. (with <a href="http://www.etheric.com/LaVioletteBooks/ether.html">color coded folmulas</a> no less) I was under the impresion that <a href="http://www.ximensions.uklinux.net/articles/rpt2.htm">the ether</a> was a long forgotten about piece of physical nastalgia. I see I was wrong. How could it be that the whole physics community have overlooked this obvious theory. I had it all wrong, I guess I should just go and burn my whole collection of physics texts. I won't need them anymore, because now we have a <a href="http://www.etheric.com/LaVioletteBooks/SQK-c.html">bright and shining star</a> of a theory to work with now. Man!, start from the "subquantum" level and work my way up, why didn't I think of that.</p>
        <p>Subquantum Kinetics...he he.</p>
        <p>I would have thought that "etheron" particles would be a bit too much to take, but this author seems to have no problem with it; so what the hey!</p>

        <p>Well, maybe not the whole family, but you can have fun. Kuro5hin has an article on creating a low budget <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2002/12/27/15929/126">bubble chamber</a>. It looks rather easy to make, the only caveat is that you need to get some dry ice. If you can secure some, it's available in most cities, then your on your way to tracking your own cosmic rays and other delights. Hmm, yet another project to add to my every expanding list. The author also lists some other sources to get more information. I think this would make an excellent weekend project.</p>

        <p>Do you ever notice that some of the things you see in the movies are far fetched. Have you ever wondered why a spaceship would bank in when flying in space. Hopefully you do as most movies use a large amount of poetic license in the name of better special effects. Now that's not necessarily a bad thing, but <a href="http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/">these guys</a> seem to find it unnerving.</p>
        <p>Their mission:<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          In the name of physics decency, to protect the minds of children everywhere, so that they may grow up in a world where they know the difference between speed and velocity, we have taken the responsibility to rate movies for their portrayal of excessively bad physics.<br />
        </blockquote>Well, if that's your cup 'o tea...

        <h3 class="title">100th Anniversary of Quantum Physics</h3>
        <p>Could someone please explain to me how it's been 100 years today from Dec 14, 1900? /. is <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/02/12/15/0235204.shtml?tid=99">reporting</a> that it's the 100th anniversary of QP, but the math still has eluded me. The discussion is worth mentioning; it's absolutely hilarious!</p>
        <p>Still it's hard to believe that QP has been going for so long. I wonder when the next revolution is going to start. Given our current rate of discovery, I wouldn't think that it should be too long until we have another theory to topple this one. Of course the new would have to topple not only QP, but the whole of the standard model. And somehow, I don't think it'll be accepted unless it incorporates the whole as one concise formula preferrably less than 3 inches in length. Kinda picky those physicists types...yep, real picky they are...</p>

        <p>I seem to always catch these at the last moment. But if your reading this tonight, get your butt outside and check out the <a title="Spacewatch Friday: Reliable Geminid Meteor Shower Peaks Dec. 13-14" href="http://www.space.com/spacewatch/geminid_meteors_021206.html">Geminid meteor shower</a> . It'll be nowhere near as good as the Leonid showers, but it sould be worth your time. Provided your in the northern hemisphere, as I don't know how it'll be in Japan or Australia. I hate having missed the Leonids because of bad weather, but the weather is clear here now. So, hopefully, I'll be a very cold person coming morning. I guess I'll have to remember the coffee.</p>

        <p>MIT has had a pilot program open for a while to their plan is to release all their course materials online.It's called <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">OpenCourseWare</a>. All the materials are free of charge and reflect the current curriculum being offered to students. They opened the program back in September, but at the moment the selection is pretty slim. Recently, one of my friends pointed me back in that direction again. This time I noticed some flash, shockwave, and java <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/global/department8.html">simulations</a> offered in their physics department. Check out the 8.02-Electricity and Magnetism Course.</p>

        <h3 class="title">SETI To Go Active In 2003</h3>
        <p>SETI (Search for ExTraterestrial Intelligence) has <a href="http://www.planetary.org/html/UPDATES/seti/SETI@home/Update_120402.html">announced</a> plans to actively search for signals next year. SETI is a project to search for electromagnetic (and more recently laser/lightwave) communication from distant planets. It has compiled a list of the most promising sources Top 100 style. They plan to revisit those sites and complete an more extensive search. This is a departure from SETI's usually passive listening techniques whereby they just listen in whatever direction the radio telescope happens to be pointing. Maybe it'll prove more successful than to a previous project to relocate the source of that elusive <a href="http://www.planetary.org/html/news/articlearchive/headlines/2002/Wow2.html">WOW!</a> signal received in 1977 and prompted a Senator to cut NASA funding for the SETI project. I never new <a href="http://www.planetary.org/html/UPDATES/seti/seti-history.html">Spielberg</a> was a SETI supporter.</p>
        <p>BTW, he's got a new <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/02/apontv.spielbergs.taken.ap/index.html">miniseries</a> on SciFi channel for those that care. I haven't seen it (I don't watch much TV.), but I'm quite sure it's good. I swear everything he touches is golden. And before all the movie buffs start flaming me, let me say that I'm NOT a movie buff. So, I'm entitled to my ignorance, and infact, I gloat in it. Yes, I loved A.I.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Lazy Ass Nitrogen Atoms; perhaps they need a little caffeine</h3>
        <p>Atoms and their particles are alway changing and interacting in a web of hyperactivity. Not these though. Some scientist have been <a href="http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/2002/split/616-2.html">observing</a> nitrogen atoms floating around in the aftermath of a dying star. The resulting low density vacuum has left a void of inactivity for these guys to find the slackers, located in the NGC3918 a planetary nubula. The slothy nitrogen was found to have lifetime of 2500 seconds. That's like eternity in atomic terms. Search me, what this is supposed to mean for astrophysics, but something tells me that It's really important. Especially since it took 3 people to come up with the measurements.</p>
        <p>No, really this could have uses in coaxing atomic systems into more stable, longer lived states. Which would be exceedingly handy when designing longer lived entanglment preceedures. Who knows maybe one day you'll be able to talk to your fiance from across the galaxy using fast than light communication built off of the resilient processes displayed by these atoms. Hey, not to mention slower refresh rate for quantum memory. I'd suck if you had this nice new quantum computer but couldn't get anything dome on it, because it was having to refresh its calculations more than it was able to actually find the solution. Decoherence is a bitch!</p>

        <h3 class="title">Quantum Computing Primer</h3>
        <p>You didn't think I missed all the fuss being made on the news about the recent developments in quantum computers did you? No, I just thought that the subject deserved a bit more than the usual go <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993114">here</a> read <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1038887645.html">this</a> link up. Although most sites did a good job of getting the word out, most didn't explain some the questions that many readers had about the field in general.</p>
        <p>So what, praytell, is all the fuss about? What is a "quantum" computer? What in 'tarnation is decoherence? How does that involve me? Why should I be excited.</p>
        <p>A quantum computer (QC) is a computer that operates on the principles and "weirdness" of quantum physics. Quantum processes are very strange in that they any given "particle" that interacts with another exists in a "superposition" of states until measured. Sort of like, and this is stretching it, say someone knocks on your door at your home and you go to answer it. Well, until you open the door and the person sees you; you (to the person that knocked on the door) are in a "superposition" of states: "home" or "not home". Only until you open the door or otherwise give indication that you are indeed "home" or not, you are BOTH "home" and "not home" and NOT "home" and "not home". (yes, you read that right) You will exist in this "superposition" until the knocker observes you (or not) by opening the door. When you are (or, again, not) observed it is known as a "collapse of the wave function" ( It's long story, but I'll cover it in another article.) Ludicrous, huh! Well that's a very vague and liberal explanation. But like it or not, that's quantum mechanics (QM). So, on with the story.</p>
        <p>It was Richard P. Feynman who was one of the first to realize that this "superposition" stuff could be very powerful in solving very complex problems where many separate variables were involved. Such as the directed Hamiltonian Path (HP) problem otherwise known as "the traveling salesman" problem. The problem involves a salesman traveling through a number of cities and only visiting them once. The problem is very easy to begin with until the number of cities he has to visit goes up. Until the problem becomes so complex that it is impractical to solve with even the fastest super computers. The problem is complex because it involves so many variables and only one solution. The only way to find out which path to take is to use "trial and error". And miscalculation along the way will lead the solution "down the wrong path" so to speak and you must start all the way over from the beginning and try another route.</p>
        <p>Why does a QC have an advantage. Lets go back to that "superposition" mumbo jumbo. QM says that any "particle" (electron, photon, etc.) that interacts with another can become "entangled" with each other. Entanglement means that when something happens to one particle it's entangle partner undergoes the same interaction. No matter how far apart they are. This is interesting because a QC designer could use this to perform many calculations at once. With each calculation knowing what the other is doing.</p>
        <p>That's all fine and well, but just how does a designer even make a QC, even in principle. First, he needs a building block. In traditional computers that building block is the transistor with that the designer can represent 1's and 0's as is convention on modern computer systems today. The QC equivalent of this would be the "qubit". With it we will build our computer in a fashion conceptually similar to convetional computers. The major differences would be manufacturing techniques used and programming methods.</p>
        <p>Herein lies the signifigance of the latest developements. Most promenent is that of the difficulties of building the physical device. The UNSW device spearheaded by <a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/STAFF/ACADEMIC/clark.html">Richard Clark</a> was based on a design from back in 1998 by the mastermind Bruce Cane of the <a href="http://www.physics.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>. Whereby two phosphorus atoms were embedded in a silicon crystal. Phosphorous atom were used because they have a slightly better fortitude when it comes to "decoherence", wereby the atom stop behaving in the way need to have the quantum effect. The reason that this development is such good news is that it has proven feasable the ability to build a quantum mechanical device on a silicon substrate. Similar to conventional computer chip manufaturing techniques. Which greatly increases the ease to which it is integrated with mainstream computing. The task was difficult because of the extremely small distances involved, because the phosphorus atoms had to be placed ~20nm from each other. For comparison standard chip manufacturers are using a 130nm process and that's considered the bleeding edge. The researchers actually acheived ~4nm! So, needless to say, the process they used was very ingenious.</p>
        <p>But, back to our computer. Say I enter a HP problem into our hypothetical QC. When the computer calculates the problem it first "entangles" as many qubits as is needed and instead of solving each route one by one. It solves them all at once! So now we have a whole array of qubits one of which holds our correct answer and just how do we go about finding it. Well, one of our more observative readers might say something like; "But doesn't reading one of the qbits collapse the wave function and if we read the wrong one we just lost the information". Yes and no, It does collapse the wave function, but since all the qubits are entangled when we read wrong (or right for that matter) qubit we don't get the solution to that single qubit's calculation. "How's that?", you say. Simple, when we read the result, because all the qubits are entengled, all the qubits' wave functions collapse and we get the average solution that the WHOLE system came to, as per QM. Hmm, just what are we going to do with this average when we only need the correct solution of one tiny insignificant qubit? Hehe...The kicker is that the single correct qubit's solution and the entire system average's solution are one and the same. So, instead of having to do multiple operations to find one solution, we did one operation to find many solutions, but the solutions are equivalent. And QM tells us that the larger the system (the more qubits involved) the more accurate it is. Behold the power of QC.</p>
        <p>So now we come to our last little piece of news. The significance of which is that this is the first time anyone has made a computation using quantum techniques on a systems proven to be in a quantum state. (that's a mouthful) The computation was carried out by <a href="http://www.lsr.ph.ic.ac.uk/">Innsbruck University</a> and involved an operation to decided whether or not a coin was the same or different on each side. It sounds simple (and it is), but the calculations were carried out on both sides at once, utilizing quantum techniques to complete the calculation twice as fast as a conventional computer calculation; again proving the feasability and power of QC.</p>
        <p>On another note not directly related (and a bit old), researchers have observed entangled photons remaining <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992564">entangled</a> even after passing through a barrier, interacting with another object, something not previously thought possible. Because it was thought that interaction with other objects caused the englement effect to disperse. This proves that the effect is much more resilient than previously thought. It could and probably will have tremendous implications on encryption and communication technologies, given further experimentation. I still think this holds the key to faster than light communication, but I'm probably just ignorant.</p>

        <h3 class="title">One ton Quarks</h3>
        <p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2502755.stm">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/01342.html">SMU</a> are reporting some reseachers that seem to have found evidence of Quark passing through Earth. They have singled out 2 linear seismic events that are best described by a 1 ton micron-sized "strange" quark moving throught the earth at a blistering 250 miles per second.</p>
        <p>The only evidence of this happening is twice during 1993. No other seismic data is available because the US Geological Survey stopped recording "unassociated" events. I thought this was peculiar, so I did a little checking up. I originally thought that maybe government budgets cuts had stripped the USGS of some of it's capabilities. But, the only thing I can find is that they just stopped keeping the "unassociated" events. "Unassociated" means the events were not correlated with a confirmed seismic event, such as a earthquake or volcanic eruption.</p>
        <p>After many google searches, I'm pretty sure they hust stopped recording these events because the sensitivity of the instruments taking the measurments have become too sensitive, so the were flooded with data or that the instruments have gotten more unreliable. I really can't tell from the documents which one, but I'll have to go with the former.</p>

          I asked Tipler which side of the Fredkin gap he is on. Does he go along with the weak version of the ultimate computer, the metaphorical one, that says the universe only seems like a computer? Or does he embrace Fredkin's strong version, that the universe is a 12 billion-year-old computer and we are the killer app? "I regard the two statements as equivalent," he answered. "If the universe in all ways acts as if it was a computer, then what meaning could there be in saying that it is not a computer?"

        Many of you know that I hold some of the same views mentioned here. I've been struggling to piece it all together, but I've thus far reach nowhere near this level of clarity. Now I know where to loook and I can see I've go a lot of reading ahead. Don't forget to read the article all the way through (follow the links to the other pages of the article). Before you shun the ideas presented as ubsurd. remember that the people the reporter is writing about are prominent scientist. And as such, many of them are responible for a large part of our understanding of the physical world. Keep an open mind.<br />
        <br />
        Now perhap you can understand why I want to be physists. What other jobs let you contemplate the nature of reality, among other things, and get (Real) paid! #cue: Beck music# Now where else do get such drama? I love this stuff.

        <h3 class="title">Meteor Shower</h3>
        <p>Don't forget about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2481681.stm">Leonid meteor shower</a> tonight, err, this morning. 0530 PST. It's supposed to be better than the one last year. I saw that one in Japan and it was spectacular. Looks like it's going to be a cold morning again this time. If it goes anything like last year it should last for a couple of hours, so get your booties out of bed. If your reading this the morning after, and beating up on yourselr. Don't. They'll be another next year, but don't count on it being as good as this or last year's. If you saw last year's, you know just how surprising it was. It was much more active than was expected.</p>
        <p>I think this years will be the same, simply because last year, by most accounts, Japan was the best vantage point. And this year North America will have the same approximate vantage and timing. Especially the timing. Looks like I'll have two good years in a row. he he, ain't I lucky!</p>
        <p>Time to get a little sleep before 0430 CST.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Crisis in Physics?</h3>Physics Today has a well written piece addressing a growing concern in the scientific community. First there were the budget cut and stagnating development funds, but that's not the major issue. I the problem seems to stem from a lack of enthusiasm. Although not without acomplishments, physicists seem to be rather unoptimistic about the discoveries made during the last few years. Instead, generally, they are reluctant to reconize their progress. Discoveries made today are sometimes seen as exceedingly trite in light of past eras. The "Standard Model" has revealed such depth and complexity that even the most exceptional have found it overwhelming. Physicist have difficulty even keeping up with their field, nevermind what is going in another colleague's. Communication between the various fields has become a rare occurance and overall, unity has suffered.<br />
        <br />
        <blockquote>
          <a title="Physics Today November 2002" href="http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-55/iss-11/p56.html">Physics Today November 2002</a><br />
          <br />
          Is it fair to assert that physics is in crisis? Certainly physicists in the US do face a crisis of funding; many years of flat research budgets and even flat-flat (that is, constant-dollar) budgets, have slowed and discouraged the new initiatives that constitute the future of US physics. Another decade of stagnant or declining funding would eliminate any pretense of the US as a world leader in physics research. That loss would be a terrible outcome both for physics and for the long-term prosperity and security of the US.
        </blockquote><br />

        Funny thing is you don't even need to be involve in actual physics (like me) to see this. Even an idiot like me can see that a large number of physicists don't regard other fields outside their own, as important as their own field. Perhaps going so far as possessing an elitist's attitude. Well, there's my two cents.

        <p>This has been reported on like everywhere. But, for the sake of completeness. The U.S. Army has developed a tracking-targeting-firing system that can now knock a shell, moving faster than the speed of sound, right out of the air. Called Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL), it successfully destroyed a supersonic mortor round during test in White Sands, New Mexico.

        <h3 class="title">Physics for your ol' man</h3>
        <p>I went to Jackson the other day with my Dad to pick up some parts for my computer. We were talking and somehow we got on the subject of why I want to study physics. Of particular intrest to him was why I would read about a subject most people dread taking in college. Nevermind studying it for fun!<br />
        (I know I'm a geek. It's cool.)</p>
        <p>I soon realized just how hard it is to explain physics. I tried explaining some of the features of superstring theory and a few particle interations. Before it was over, I probably covered each subject like 3 times. But even after he had a suitable understanding of what I was saying, he still couldn't understand what was so exciting. Nevermind what was so desirable about symmetry!</p>
        <p>I think it's akin to trying to get someone excited about baseball when they are not familiar with the game, nor any sport for that matter.</p>
        <p>Maybe I should have used the "two slits" experiment or explained boiling "watched" celcium atoms and all the wierdness that insues. Perhaps that would have pique his interest. Nevertheless, I've given up on trying to talk about it with my family. I guess I'll have to wait till I get into school to have an informed discusion.</p>
        <p>Some light reading for those still interested:<a title="The Official String Theory Web Site" href="http://superstringtheory.com/index.html">The Official String Theory Web Site</a> Great for beginners and (oxymoron alert!) advanced beginners like me.</p>
