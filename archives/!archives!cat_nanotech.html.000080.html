        <h3 class="title">Nuclear Batteries</h3>
        <p>So far most of the nanotech articles reported on here have relied on glucose in the blood stream to power most of the devices proposed for medical uses. Well, just what happens if you need to use the same technology outside the body or in a fashion that doesn't allow a piggyback ride so to speak. Most ideas center around batteries, but that presents a problem in it's self. Common batteries we use today don't scale that well down to the size we need and still provide adequate power. Enter <a href="http://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~jake/res/batteries.htm">nuclear batteries</a>. These proposed power sources, although dubious in name, could provide a viable solution. It uses really weak radioactive isotopes. So weak in fact that after just a couple of half lives the emitted radiation is lower than that of concrete. It uses a level to collect charges as particle are emitted. As the charges build up it create an attraction that between that of the level and base creating movement that powers a servo that acts as a generator converting the attraction movement into useable electricity. When the charges build up enough, the level move into contact with the base and the charges are equalled resetting the lever and starting the cycle all over again. I'm still not sure why they don't just use the charge difference it's self as a battery, but I'm sure I've gotten my understanding of physics somehow. Anywho, it works and now they are working to scale it down to ever smaller sizes so it can be used in future MEMS.</p>

        <p>More reasons to try for that 250,000 Feynman prize. If these people keep it up well have nanotechnology equivalants to every cell function in the body. But I guess that the plan, huh? Not that it a bad thing.</p>
        <p>The strange thing is that these devices consume less energy than there repective biological equivelants. Go figure.</p>

        <p><a title="Respirocytes: A Mechanical Artificial Red Cell TOC" href="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html">Respirocytes: A Mechanical Artificial Red Cell TOC</a></p>
        <p>I reported earlier on these, but now I've found the full proposal by the Foresight Institue. If you remember, these devices are a proposed red blood cell replacement/augment. The proposal, which at first seems preposterous, now looks very promising. All that is left to is find a manufacturing technique for sizes so small. As if that was easy, right!</p>
        <p>Hmm, I wonder if these would obsolve the need for SCUBA apperatus. It'd be delightful if these could eliminate the"bends". Just imagine going swimming underwater for 4 hours without ever taking a breath. You'd probably need some way of reading your respirocytes oxygen content before you could do that safely though. I'd suck if you forgot to take a deep enough breath and expecteed the full 4 hours worth only to find out otherwise; 70 meters below the surface!</p>

        <h3 class="title">Uncounterfeitable money</h3>
        <p>Here's an intresting article on some possible solutions to a possible money counterfeiting problem in the wake of nanotechnology. The problem under scrutiny is that if you can easily manipulate the very atoms and molecules of everyday objects; what's going to stop someone from creating perfect counterfeit currency?

        <h3 class="title">So you want to live forever?</h3>Sorry for posting another Wired article, but hey, these are MY personal notes. And the articles have just been so good lately. I hope your reading all this stuff. It's really mindblowing to hear about. I can't wait 'till I get to study this in school.<br />
        <br />
        <blockquote>

          Respirocytes are artificial red blood cells -- nano machines -- that Freitas sees as an emergency treatment that technicians could, for example, inject into a patient who has suffered smoke inhalation.<br />
          <br />
          With an injection of just 5 cc's of respirocytes, he said, someone could run a 5-minute mile (12 mph) for 12 minutes without taking a breath.

        Leave it to the South to have something idiotic to say too:<br />

          Take, for example, Miss Alabama's argument, if you can call it that, given during the Miss America competition in 1994. The competition host asked: "If you could live forever, would you want to, and why?" Miss Alabama answered, "I would not live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever."
        </blockquote><br />

        I wonder why the rest of the country and world looks on us as uneducated charlatans. Well, no, I don't on second thought.

        <p>On the same token as my previous post. Further <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/wo_cameron021502.asp">developments</a> have come about. Near immediate applications range from powered superman suits to prosthetics.</p>
