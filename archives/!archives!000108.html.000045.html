        <h3 class="title">Benjamin Stein Speaks Out</h3>
        <p>Everyones favorite genious, Ben Stein from "Win Ben Stein's Money" has written a nice piece on <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=64&amp;e=3&amp;u=/fo/20021213/bs_fo/2002_12_how_to_ruin_american_enterprise">"How to Ruin American Enterprise"</a>. It's right on the money I'd say. An excellent critique of the social decline currently underway in the public at large. The part about the school system playing to the lowest common denomenator is the most important aspect I my opinion. But don't forget about the march of legal action that has all but frozen innovation for fear of lawsuits. It is always the "other guy" you know.</p>
        <p>Mass market public relations has caused become so well integrated into our society that we actually think that wev'e succeeded in gaining free will. A milestone for PR firms (read: propaganda). Finally the government has a public that is content with the things that they see in the media and society today. Oblivious to the fact that we are now only brainwashed from massive repetion and blindly follow the suggestions of those that have the capital to finance big money campains: it doesn't matter if it's a new SUV or war in Iraq.</p>

        <p>I would like to mail a letter to Ben Stein who hosted "Turn Ben Stein On". Does anyone out there know of a current forwarding address for him? I have sent email to addresses I thought were good, but have recieved no reply, so maybe they are not good email addresses. I assumed he would have a secretary or something that handles this sort of thing. I would appreciate it, Thanks.
