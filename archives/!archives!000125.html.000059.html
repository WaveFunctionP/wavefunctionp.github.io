        <h3 class="title">A Level-headed Look at Microsoft</h3>
        <p>Microsoft has been through a lot during the past few years. Legal battles, questionable security initiatives (Palladium), and confusing software platforms (.Net) have all served to drag the company to new lows. Many claim the eventual demise of the juggernaut and still otherwise. What's going on at Redmond? Kuro5hin has an <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2003/1/2/153157/7696">interview with Adam Barr</a>, a former Microsoft developer who seems to have levelheaded view at to what has happened. It's hard to get truth when it comes to Microsoft simple because most of the most outspoken are either adamantly against or for the software giant.<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          Many people consider Microsoft to be this all-powerful entity that always gets its way and succeeds in whatever it attempts (whether through technical ability, luck, marketing, or illegal means). But in fact, if you look back at all the initiatives Microsoft has attempted, most of them have failed. Remember Windows at Work, an attempt to unify all office machines on a network? Or TrueImage, a clone of the PostScript page description language? Or ACE, the Advanced Computing Environment, designed to replace the Intel PC architecture? If you look at all the things that Microsoft has boldly announced with a gaggle of industry partners, the success rate is maybe 10 to 20 percent. So pick any ten things that Microsoft is attempting now: Auto PC, cell phone operating system, set-top box, Xbox, electronic books, Internet Gaming Zone, Tablet PC, Pocket PC, speech recognition, MSN. The odds are that only one or two of those will actually succeed.<br />
        </blockquote>The last time I read anything that wasn't biased with ridicule or praise was <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/auletta/home.html"><i>World War 3.0</i> by Ken Auletta</a>. The book was written before the antitrust trails were over and explains the mentality going on at Microsoft and enlightens the viewer on some of the details of the battle. It's a good read for any who want to know more than is put out by the media and open-source community.
        <p></p>
        <p>My view: Simply put, I believe that Microsoft is a vicious competitor. Do I believe that the actions it has taken to compete are unfair? Yes, but I don't think that it came from specific management strategies, but more from a mentality to compete. From what I read Microsoft breeds a brutal competitive atmosphere and allows too much independence to it's various departments. Overly zealous employees work hard to compete with a small guy fights giant mentality and hasn't quite gotten the picture that's they're no longer the small guy. Perhaps Microsoft is just <u>too good</u> a competitor and needs to let it's enemies catch up. Microsoft needs to realize that, even though it is a very unstable market were a good idea can overtake a giant's, it still can't afford to act like it's playing catch up and act like the leader it is.</p>
        <p>Yes, I still <i>want to</i> believe in Microsoft.</p>
        <p>P.S. I have to agree with Mr. Barr, Linux is still too much tech for the average Joe. Linux on the desktop will never see widespread use until developers start working to a better experience. It can't be just as good, it has to be a better experience for users to switch.(costs aside)</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at January 3, 2003 01:44 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=125" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>

        <p>IMHO, Microsoft is where they are because noone else can compete. If they could then they would. Let the market decide if Gates gets richer, not some 80k judge who's jealousy gets the best of him.</p>
        <p>What Microsoft's competetors are after amounts to getting a judge to tell Ford that they have to include Keith Black engines in Ford automobiles. Or... telling Chevy that it is unfair to Pioneer Electronics for Chevy to only include Chevy sterios in Chevy automobiles. The concept is assinine from the start. If somebody wants 1500 hoursepower they can go get their own Keith Black and install it. If somebody thinks Pioneer makes a better radio there's a sterio shop on every street corner. Buy one but don't ask Chevy to install a competitors product in their product. O.K. I'm done with that rant...</p><span class="comments-post">Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;batemanb&#64;cox-internet&#46;com">Bill Bateman</a> on January 9, 2003 08:28 PM</span>

        <p>I'm inclined to agree, but such is the state of our government were big money lobbyist can get anything they want. Which is exactly why Microsoft has been smeared through the courts because they refuse to inact a lobbying campaign like their competetors. A lot of people don't realize that, until very recently, Microsoft leaves it's hands out of the government and just bothers itself with ruling the computer industry. Thats a policy that I wish a lot more companies would take up:do business, not politics. It's almost as if we need to add to the constitution the separation of commerce and state same as that of religion. Or some kind of protections. I rant, but these kind of discussions are nothing new and have been around for quite some time. It's a wonder that this problem still exists.</p>
        <p>&lt;sarcasm&gt; Monopolies are everywhere, it's just that only a lucky few get the honor of being condemned for it. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p><span class="comments-post">Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;derfuehrer&#64;mctphysics&#46;com">Der Fuehrer</a> on January 11, 2003 12:35 AM</span>
