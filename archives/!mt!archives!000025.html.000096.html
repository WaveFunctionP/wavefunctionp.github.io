        <h3 class="title">Top Sytle Pro 3 Review</h3>Well, I promised it to you and, finally, after long debate and many revisions, I present my <a title="TopStyle Pro HTML Editor, CSS Editor, XHTML Editor for Windows" href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">TopStyle Pro HTML Editor, CSS Editor, XHTML Editor for Windows</a> review. For those wondering, Top style provides a intuitive interface and handy tools to validate and clean up what would otherwise be very tedious and time consuming work.<br />
        <br />
        This is just the first of the original content that I plan to provide on this stie. My plans include much more. To include: detailed reviews, witty essays, and powerful editorials. Along with my daily web commentary, and insiteful news post. Provided I have the time of course. This is just a hobby for me after all.<br />
        <a name="more" id="more"></a> I found <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">Top Style Pro 3</a> from a need to edit my CSS files, but what I found was so much more. I can't say adaquately how much I love this program. Enthusiasm aside, let's dig in.<br />
        No really, what is TS. Feature list is as follows, ripped right from the web site:<br />
        <br />
        <div class="quote">
          HTML and XHTML editing - TopStyle comes into its own as a powerful HTML and XHTML editor!<br />

          Full Screen Preview - Display your HTML or CSS documents in a full screen preview which can be split between Internet Explorer and Mozilla (Netscape Gecko).<br />
          Related Styles - See at a glance which styles are related to the current HTML tag or CSS selector.<br />
          File Explorer - Easily navigate your local files and network connections, and create links with simple drag-and-drop actions.<br />
          Clip Library - Store your favorite code snippets in a central location for reuse.<br />

          <br />
        </div>Heewwww! man, thats a mouth full. So whats that saying. It's saying, that if you prefer to edit you html and css manually and generally use WYSIWYG editors for basic layout only; this it the product for you. It even support most scripts.<br />
        <br />
        Where TS shines most is CSS editing. You use a separtate "selector box" to choose your selectors, ID's and elements. You can use a simple integrated interface or, if you like, you can organize you tools by use of a dock system. Those of you that are familiar with Photoshop or Dreamweaver, will feel right at home. And, yes, you can easily switch and save dock layouts by a simple layout selector.<br />
        <br />
        TS is not for the faint of heart, it has a pretty intense learning curve. It's nowhere near that of Photoshop, Dreamweaver and the like though. I found that it took me about full 6 hours of work to where I was comforable and had everything how I wanted.<br />
        <br />
        Also of note is the preview panels. They are up dated after every change, so no switching back and forth between modes to see what the finished product will look like. Also, I mentioned earlier that TS will check you code for errors. Well, first thing you'll want to do is; decide what all will you want it to check for. It'll show compatibility alerts and error for a seemingly endless list of browsers and standards, from Netscape 3.0 to CSS 2.0, not to mention even provide solutions for and reasons behind the errors and warnings. And simplely clicking on the error/warning will automatically select the apropriate tag or ID.<br />
        <br />
        Color management is a snap. With a simple palette selector that link to the same color elements. For instance, if to choose to change the color of my text that have been formatted to "black", simplely select "black" and goto the color chooser and change to another color. Say "Red", now all the elements on my page that are the "black" will be change to "red". Simple as that! No more repetitious cutting and pasting, and no more need for macros or "find and replace". Smooth as butta!<br />
        <br />
        With all that said, I have 2 gripes. First is this package would be absolutely wonderful if it had an FTP client intergrated. That is a sore point to an otherwise top notch program. (They allow a plugin to an external ftp client, but that's no substitute in my opinion.) Second is price, 50 bucks is still a little steep for such a specialized program, no matter how good. I'm so cheap, I'm still using the <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/download/index.asp">demo</a> and dread the day when the demo runs out, as I'm morally (and legally as well) obligated to buy it when it expires.<br />
        <br />
        TS is excellent, and I whole-heartedly recommend this product to anyone who doesn't mind editing text, prefer to do so, and want completely clean code for there web pages. <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at November 5, 2002 02:40 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=25" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
