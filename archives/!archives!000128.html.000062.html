        <p>I've finally gotten through with my application to MIT. All that there is to do is sit back and wait until spring. And as fate would have it, because of a less than impressive showing on the SAT's, I've began to have doubts as to why I would even try and apply. Thankfully, I'm no pretentious high school kiddie, but have had my share of disappointments whenever it came to scholastic endeavors. However, as of late, I've been feeling the heat of anxiety and the foreboding presence of impending disappointment. Call it insecurity, call it normal jitters, but whatever it is. I don't like it. I was uplifted earlier this week when I read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58951-2002Dec31.html">this article</a> at the Washingtom Post. Hey, normally I don't go for this kind of "feel good" type of writing, but I've found it really uplifting. It's about a research group that does a study of applicants that got denied admission to there "Dream" college. What they found was that even though they weren't given the brand name college treatment; they still did just as well as those that did get accepted. They call it the Spielberg Effect for reason that soon become obvious. Now, common knowledge has it that this is no new revelation, but it's still striking to see it coming from a regimented study.</p>
        <p>Also of note is <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html">another article</a> that rubbed me right. For the time being, I'll have to settle with the little bit of consolation I get from these articles until I get the verdict because no amount of intellectualizing will subdue me from biting at my nails. Wish me luck ;)</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at January 5, 2003 03:51 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=128" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
