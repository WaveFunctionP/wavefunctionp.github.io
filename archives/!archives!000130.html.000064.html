        <h3 class="title">Apple Making Headlines...With Me At Least</h3>
        <p>Steve Job's keynote at the MacWorldExpo has been creating <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1041978831.html">quite a stir</a>. <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0301/07.powerbooks.php">Lust inspiring laptops</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">better browsers</a> and a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/07/1920248">slew of software</a> being released for the Mac. Now I'm firmly in the PC camp, but sometimes, especially as of late, I doubt my non-Unix upbringing. Apple's marketing campaign has begun to thoroughly work it's way into my head. I have to say that I've been thoroughly tempted into at least trying a Mac. Now I know what you are saying. "It's a phase; it will pass". I know, but they're so cute. When I saw the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>, I immediately began to regret buying my Nomad Jukebox. But that's no big deal. The problem is that I keep coming across <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">Mac only applications</a>, that I really wish I could use. Top that with the fact that I'm just sick and tired of fiddling with every aspect of the PC. Using the PC is a chore, and one that I'm finding myself having a harder and harder time justifying.</p>
        <p>The grass is almost always greener on the other side. Yes, I've used that argument too. To no great effect I might add. It seem every time I turn around I'm bombarded by "bad design". I'm not only talking about the technology in PCs, but aesthetics, maybe I'm getting soft, but I'd like an app to look as well as it performs. It even seems as if the latter is getting harder to find also. No one seems to be taking the time and effort the is need to ensure their product is finished before they release it. From my experience, when something attains a cult like following it at least warrants a passing glance. I too often find myself staring instead. I've been seduced by the Mac community. Given time I'm sure that I'll buy one. Most likely when I go looking for college lifestyle functionality. That will not be any time soon unless I secure a surplus of funds.Still, that 12" <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Powerbook</a> looks sweet. Until that time I can only look on as a spectator....a dreadfully envious spectator.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at January 8, 2003 05:59 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=130" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
