                <p>Born, raised, and live in Mississippi. I love science, computers and technology in general. I am an unabashed
                    nerd. As a child, I was often found dabbling with a chemstry set, performing experiments, or constructing
                    a fort in the woods.
                </p>
                <p>I've dabbled with computers since a young age. My first computer was a Tandy 1000sx. I remember playing around
                    with BASIC, copying and entering programs in by hand from books we had in the house. Or making text rpgs
                    with friends in Turbo Pascal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I played the trumpet in the band in middle school and high school. I was also heavily involved in a frontier historical society
                    called Frontier Camping Fellowship, as well as the Royal Rangers through my church.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am now heavily involved in gaming, in particular, I am community leader/influencer for the rogue class in World of Warcraft.
                    I also help maintain a tool for the rogue community called Shadowcraft. I am also a mod developer for
                    Kerbal Space Program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have ongoing interests in a variety of topics like aerospace, sustainability, vernacular architecture, physics, nanotechnology,
                    medicine, and nutition.

                <p>Professionally, I've worked in network/computer administration in the Marine Corps while I was enlisted.
                    I went on to study Physics at the University of Southern Mississippi, where I have contributed to published
                    research on Metalic Nitride Fullerenes.</p>
                <p>I now practice software development. In particular I have worked on a variety of projects related to
                    the games, World of Warcraft and Kerbal Space Program. I publish and contribute to open source projects
                    mostly on GitHub. I also contract/consult privately and on Upwork.
