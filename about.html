                <h4>About Me:</h4>
                <p>Hello. My name is Corey Thompson. This is my personal website.</p>
                <p>Born, raised, and live in Mississippi. I love science, computers and technology in general. I am an unabashed
                    nerd.
                </p>
                <p>I've dabbled with computers since a young age. My first computer was a Tandy 1000sx. I remember plaing around
                    with BASIC, copying programs from books we had in the house. Or making text rpgs with friends in Pascal.</p>
                <p>Professionally, I've worked in network/computer administration in the Marine Corps when I was enlisted. I
                    went on to study Physics at the University of Southern Mississippi, where I have contributed to published
                    research on the topics of Metalic Nitride Fullerenes.</p>
                <p>I now work and study software development. In particular I hve worked on a variety of projects related to
                    gaming, which is another of my passions. I publish and contribute to open source projects mostly on GitHub.
                    I also contract/consult privately and on Upwork.
                </p>

                <h4>About this site:</h4>
                <p>This is my personal playground and resume. You'll also find my more notable public projects. I also use this
                    to experiment with web technologies.</p>
