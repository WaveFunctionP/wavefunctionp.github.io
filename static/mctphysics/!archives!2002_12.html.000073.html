        <h3 class="title">Bush's Misguided Advisor</h3>
        <p>Life extension has a new highly influential foe. Meet Leon Kass, Bush's bioethics council and he's often seen parading around <a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4">advocating death.</a> Yes, he wants you to die:</p>
        <p></p>
        <blockquote>
          "The promise of immortality and eternity answers rather to a deep truth about the human soul: the human soul yearns for, longs for, aspires to some condition, some state, some goal toward which our earthly activities are directed but which cannot be attained in earthly life," says Kass. "The human taste for immortality, for the imperishable and the eternal, is not a taste that the biomedical conquest of death could satisfy. We would still be incomplete; we would still lack wisdom; we would still lack God's presence and redemption."<br />
        </blockquote>Mr. Kass, I hope you don't intend to impose your religious beliefs on me. I, for one, don't require death for spiritual enlightenment. I think many of you feel the same way. I know I'd like the chance to meet my great great great grandchildren.
        <p></p>
        <p>Now keep in mind this is all speculation and we still have a long way to go if we get there at all, but it provides a very motivational goal. We'll just have to wait and see how this nanotechnology "revolution" will pan out.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Unified Theory Exposed!!! Return of the Ether</h3>
        <p>It's nice to know that these guy's have got it all figured out. (with <a href="http://www.etheric.com/LaVioletteBooks/ether.html">color coded folmulas</a> no less) I was under the impresion that <a href="http://www.ximensions.uklinux.net/articles/rpt2.htm">the ether</a> was a long forgotten about piece of physical nastalgia. I see I was wrong. How could it be that the whole physics community have overlooked this obvious theory. I had it all wrong, I guess I should just go and burn my whole collection of physics texts. I won't need them anymore, because now we have a <a href="http://www.etheric.com/LaVioletteBooks/SQK-c.html">bright and shining star</a> of a theory to work with now. Man!, start from the "subquantum" level and work my way up, why didn't I think of that.</p>
        <p>Subquantum Kinetics...he he.</p>
        <p>I would have thought that "etheron" particles would be a bit too much to take, but this author seems to have no problem with it; so what the hey!</p>
        <p>Aren't Mondays so much fun.</p>

        <h3 class="title">AmphetaDesk SideBar</h3>
        <p>I've been trying in vein to find a adequate news program for windows. There are a few on the market, but few utilize a 3 pane design with a simple interface. Well, that is 'till I found <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">AmphetaDesk</a>. I've used it before, but because it didn't use the requisite 3 window panes, I left in alone to find another solution. I did like AmphetaDesk for it's simplicity and light weight. After a few weeks of using <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">NewzCrawler</a>, I slowly began to dislike many of is quirks and especially that I was going to have to pay for it come a few days. It really didn't justify the cost in my mind.</p>
        <p>Fast Forward to yesterday. I reloaded AmphetaDesk and found out you could customize the templates used to generate the headlines page. I've also been hearing a lot of noise on the net about Mozilla sidebars. Couple that with a little JavaScript and viola, 3 pane (sorta) RSS newsreader mozilla sidebar. <a href="/pics/amdesk.jpg">[screenshot]</a> It's a bad pic, but you get the idea.</p>
        <p>The core idea is to use AmphetaDesk to aggregate the feeds, along with it's feed management features, modify the index template to fit in a sidebar and add some collapsible menus to the feed list. Tweak and you've got a totally free, easy to use, way to read news feeds.</p>
        <p>All you need to get it running is to <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/index.html">download and install</a> AmphetaDesk, copy this <a href="/files/index.txt">index file</a> to your template folder(right click, save target as, rename to index.html), and <a href="javascript:window.sidebar.addPanel%20('AmphetaDesk',%20'http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html','')">install the side bar</a>. (The last link is a javascript that installs the AmphetaDesk URI: "http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html", to your sidebar)</p>
        <p>Note. I've removed the excerpt/description container from the perl script because the list was too long for my tastes. If you want it just copy the appropriate container from the default template to the new one.</p>
        <p>Remember to back up your default template (rename it, or copy it to another directory) before you over write it with the new template. It really doesn't matter, because you should have the zip file you downloaded that you can restore from, but it might save you some trouble if you've already made some changes to the template that you want to save.</p>
        <p>All page formatting is done in DOM, so in other words the sidebar is just a webpage. CSS and scripting all apply the same as if it were in the main window. So, CSS is how I chose to apply style. target="_content" in the "a" tags makes the links display in the main window instead of the side bar. Sidebar information can be <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/catalog/web-developer/sidebar/">found here</a> and an AmphetaDesk template <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/skinning.html">explanation is here</a>. (Don't know perl? Neither do I, all you need to know is all variables start with "$", other than that you'll catch on pretty quick)</p>
        <p>Enough of this noise, have fun. Remember to tell me what you think, any suggestions?</p>

        <h3 class="title">Bubble Chambers - Great Fun for the Whole Family!</h3>
        <p>Well, maybe not the whole family, but you can have fun. Kuro5hin has an article on creating a low budget <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2002/12/27/15929/126">bubble chamber</a>. It looks rather easy to make, the only caveat is that you need to get some dry ice. If you can secure some, it's available in most cities, then your on your way to tracking your own cosmic rays and other delights. Hmm, yet another project to add to my every expanding list. The author also lists some other sources to get more information. I think this would make an excellent weekend project.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Bad Physics in Movies</h3>
        <p>Do you ever notice that some of the things you see in the movies are far fetched. Have you ever wondered why a spaceship would bank in when flying in space. Hopefully you do as most movies use a large amount of poetic license in the name of better special effects. Now that's not necessarily a bad thing, but <a href="http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/">these guys</a> seem to find it unnerving.</p>
        <p>Their mission:<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          In the name of physics decency, to protect the minds of children everywhere, so that they may grow up in a world where they know the difference between speed and velocity, we have taken the responsibility to rate movies for their portrayal of excessively bad physics.<br />
        </blockquote>Well, if that's your cup 'o tea...

        <h3 class="title">Cloned Baby Born</h3>
        <p>I find it interesting that one the first things that is mentioned about the supposed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/science/27CLON.html">cloned baby</a> is that a "religious sect" is the one responible. Could they possibly be more rude. When a Baptist or Muslim is mentioned in the news they aren't referred to as a "sect". They are given their due respect and referred by their affiliation. Not slandered by refusing to call them by their chosen name.</p>
        <p>Then there's the fact that people seem to find it more interesting to note that religion's beliefs as if to imply that it is ludicrus to believe as they do. Now I don't subscribe to this religions beliefs, but it seems to me that many people hold a equally unplausable beliefs:</p>
        <p>The belief some people hold that human life shouldn't be cloned. Same for anyone that argues that stem cell research shouldn't be allowed because it's unethical. Who are they to say when life is sacred and when it's not. When a cell is a cell or when it's something more. Just because something developes into a human, doesn't mean that before it gets to that point it should be subject to human rights. Or should it? I'm a reductionist so I have a hard time seeing the difference between a advanced chemical reaction and life at that level.</p>
        <p>For that matter, if we want to take that reasoning (that a human embryo in more than just another cell) to it's logical conclusion it's seems to me that then we would be surrounded by bigots. After all, surgery and many medical treatments (tumors) all involve killing cells, in a fully developed human being no less. How is that different. Why can you do one, but not the other. I don't see how someone can firmy hold to their beliefs just because they "believe" the to be true. Even when presented with an obvious contradiction.</p>
        <p>Just because an embryo *might* develope into a person, somehow that justifies banning useful research. Why is it that genetic research is fine if it's for exclusively for medical purposes, but not alright for me to say what color hair my child should have. We are on the brink surpassing biological evolution, but the one thing that allows us it contemplate it, is the same thing that keeps us from using for reasons of morality? Come on people, our intelligence got us here and dropped the blueprints to our very existence right on our lap. Why we can't use it? It's absurd.</p>
        <p>The day the human race realizes that we are a enormously complicated system of molecules that has developed a superiority complex; the sooner when can move on to a more productive existence. The sooner that we find a more acceptable understanding of complexity and chaos, the sooner we begin to understand our true condition. One might say that life wasn't unique or what would be the value of human life if you believe that we're nothing more than a pile of atoms. The value comes from the complexity, it's what makes each and everyone of us unique. Like many complex system the finished product is more than what is put in. So in that sense each person would still be valuable; not just a lump of talking carbon. But it is kind of funny to look at it that way. Go on try it next time you see someone, you'll see what I mean by the result is more than the sum. A most powerful and undeniably hillarious example. Humanistic ethics are still intact, just slightly....altered.</p>

        <h3 class="title">More Site Features</h3>
        <p>As you see, I've have yet another site design. It's nothing major, just a few CSS tweaks. I like the general layout, so I won't be changing that. I just wanted something that was a little easier on the eyes and that still provided a definite structure to the news post without being so rigid looking. The change in fonts helps in readablity, while a change in the hyperlinks' formatting cleans up the text. I standardized the font size; choosing to use a fixed "px" value instead of the more general "normal", "x-small", etc. values. I noticed that the different browsers were displaying the text size much differently. Using a fixed pitch solved the sizing problems, and now you should see this site's text at the size they were intended.</p>
        <p>A few people have noted that the text size was too small. That should solve the problem, but to insure that the more visually impaired reader can see the text; I've included a simple script to change the text size of each post either smaller or larger to suit each individual's tastes. You can do this with most browsers in the options, but I some people don't know how to do this. Besides that, it gave me an excuse to use my new found Javascript skills. All you need to do is click the apropriate link on the navbar to change the text size. I'll post the script later in another article for those of you that want to know how write the script.</p>
        <p>i just wonder how long this design will last...</p>

        <h3 class="title">The Web now has a Voice</h3>
        <p>In perhaps one of the most <a href="http://www.earstudio.com/projects/listeningPost.html">disturbing</a> things I've ever heard, you can hear the voice of the web. But really it's more than that; the site collects conversations on various forums and chat rooms and combines them statisticly to produce a spoken soundscape. It uses different pitches and tones to mark new topics and indicate general traffic intensity.</p>
        <p>The following from the web site:<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          What does the collective voice of the internet sound like? Countless others are with you when you browse the web, some reading the same words at the same time, and yet you have no way of sensing their presence. Listening Post gives voice to this vast, silent world, transforming collective online activity and communication into a multi-layered sound installation. This uniquely designed space monitors thousands of online exchanges in real time, revealing the patterns and rhythms of people communicating with each other.<br />
        </blockquote>The result it quite unnerving in my opinion. It made me real uneasy to listen to it, but it probably had something to do with the way they chose the voice and sound patterns. I couldn't connect to the Bell Labs site at the moment. (It's been /.ed) Nevertheless, I'm a changed man after hearing it. I don't think I'll ever get it out of my head.
        <p></p>
        <p>But don't let that stop you from checking it out. Maybe I just caught it at the wrong moment. (I'm not sure if it changes or if it is just an example.) I need a drink....</p>

        <h3 class="title">Tweaking Site Layout</h3>
        <p>I've been messing around with the site layout in my never ending quest for perfection. Some of you (and by that, I mean most of you) are running IE in one of it's various versions. Despite careful plodding to the contrary, I couldn't coax it into display a "fixed" CSS element. So the little "Powered by ...Copyright" bar is displaying below the banner instead of floating fixedly on the bottom of the page. It's a limitation of IE the best I can tell. As this is a standards compliant (usually) web page, one might be quick to shun any user that complains about problems displaying the page. But I look at it this way: It just one more reason you should be running <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. It's free and you'll get the full benefit of knowing that your not perpetuating a software monopoly. Not to mention, see this site the way it was intended.</p>
        <p>I don't usually shun any one software solution over the other, but in this case I have to make an exception. I used to be an entrenched IE user. I really loved it. It was easy to use and a snap to extend with plugins. It didn't have that whole funky UI feel as it was designed by MS, so the experience was what I had become accostomed to. I've tried to use other browsers. I've used Opera, but after not even the first month I found myself going back to good old IE. I even tried Mozilla ealier only to get the same results: a less thatn optimal browsing experience. Fast forward to the 1.0 release of Mozilla. I read about the new release and decided to give it another go. Needless to say the "experiment" is still going. I just found myself using it contantly instead of me forcing myself to use it. I was drawn to it, especially after I discovered the new skin that came with it. I look back at IE now and wonder how I used such an old and bloated browser for so long. Just looking at the thing makes me cringe. I dread using the few apps that require IE as the default browser or engine to display web content. So, there you have itgo get Mozilla, if you can, download it, love it, worship it...</p>
        <p>Enough of the Mozilla plug, the reason I have the new footer is that I wanted to provided links to "document compliance" sites, but not display those funcky gifs they provided. I tend to favor text anyway. I never liked those flashy pics that didn't seem to fit in. Besides I'm no good at editing pictures, as I have no sense of aethetics. So the word is, as usual, if you want to get the most from this site. Go get a standards compliant browser, and see just how much better your internet surfing experience can be.</p>
        <p>This will be increasingly important as I start to add more DOM complant javascripting services on this site. Who knows maybe I'll make a Mozilla sidebar as an extra incentive.</p>

        <p>The growth of the internet has had an enormous impact on social collaboration. It's seems as if we've only touched the surface. What lies ahead, although unknown, is at once interesting, treacherous, and definitley revolutionary. Here I explore a few ideas on what may come. Just a few of the more surprising results of a pervasive and obiquitous web community. One that transends the computer on which is was built. The very nature and mentality on society at large may see a significant shift in thinking.</p>
        <p>I still find it intriguing to speculate over how the internet will <a href="http://www.praxagora.com/andyo/ar/ip_owners.html">change</a> the way we access information and art. The net has been going for some time, but I think we've yet to harness the full power that open collaboration has to offer. Many people still choose to just read a site's content despite the authors effort to provide and open forum for discussion; even *gasp* here at MCTPhysics. I've had a growing suspicion that this current debate over intellectual property issues will take a more optimistic turn, but I don't think things have gotten as bad as they are going to get. Major IP owners and distributors have yet to use up their substantial power base and I fear that the battle will be long and hard. Only until we've reached the breaking point with Mom and Pop realizing that there favorite media can no longer be used in a fair and reasonable way. They will see that it's a result of heavy handed politics and regulation by their favorite Senator or Congressman with substantial campaign contributions from said entities. I see that as the crucial turning point, and I think we've a way to go before that happens.</p>
        <p>It doesn't stop there though and I'm not sure if sure which will happen first. The next revolution will be collaboration on a whole new level. Many people working on one piece of artwork or music. Books, journals and news papers being published by people by people who've never even met? This already happens on a significant scale already, but I think we've just touched the surface. Government and organizations that are run totally online, but have appreciable influence offline. This is really interesting. Perhaps in the distant future we will have an America that is run totally online with each interest area (economics, foreign policy, local zoning regulations, education) all run, not by a bureaucracy of disinterested political types, but by expert committees and open discussion forums accessible by anyone interested. This is the convergence that I see as the emergence of true democracy, where everyone has a voice and is free to speak it in a proportional manner, and have the same power to change as the next guy. No more will people have to concern themselves with topic that they don't understand if they don't want to, and everyone can be assured of legislation on issues by a true consensus of individuals in their area of expertise.</p>
        <p>At first site this seems site this seems preposterous. Perhaps this is a bit utopian, but if you can believe with me that we do not have a democracy here in America, but some sort of media giant monarchy. Then maybe you can see a need for something new. Maybe this is a back to basics philosophy to go back and revisit the logistical limitations that the Forefathers had when they drafted the Constitution. This won't come about over night, and presumable nowhere in my lifetime, but maybe my children will have the benefit of a more open and socially reflective government. It'll happen in phases. If you listen closely, you can hear the first whispers. The U.S. government is standardizing it's online efforts and you can see the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/23/technology/23NECO.html">beginnings</a> of a collaborative effort in the mandatory forums and feedback systems planned.</p>
        <p>This plan goes beyond any system of online voting, although this is encompassed in its whole. The details are vague and many problems are unforeseeable. Who knows if whether or not our expert system will not be slighted to the views of the population of that interest sector or if it will still reflect and the general opinion of the population at large, given adequate understanding of the issues involved. This system in engendered off the belief that people tend to be compassionate and understanding and appeals directly to our social nature. When dealing with their fellow man., and given the opportunity to see outside themselves to consider the impact of their decisions as an impact on society at large. Not just another insignificant ballot in the box for some politician that they could care less about; never mind not even caring about. In other words, this will depend solely on appealing to the higher values of the human conscience. It's a lofty goal, but after 9/11, one has a hard time deigning that the American heart isn't dead.</p>
        <p>Maybe one day the president will be nothing more than a figure head similar to Britain's Queen. Again all this is speculation, but I'd really like to here your feedback on the comments board.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Michael Moore Gets Searched By The Secret Service</h3>
        <p>Well, that's a grabber headline if I ever heard one. To clarify this was not the THE Michael Moore of Columbine fame, but a Vietnam vet in <a href="http://www.sianews.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=458">North Carolina.</a> Just another example of the someone who made "the list". Hmm..maybe I can make "the list" too. The article goes on to talk about the whole incident and speculate on everyone favorite indepenant film maker's response. One more reason, to be all the more suspicious of our governments intentions.</p>
        <p>I noted earlier that propaganda leads our society by sheer force of repetition. I'd have to clarify the problem that I see as the most crucial. Democracy depends on each individual to have an opinion and stating it. Nowadays, even the most educated and opinionated person doesn't have an opinion on all the topics faced in our society today. So, the problem lies with our inherent limitation to be able to make a judgement on issues that show up on TV and other media outlets. I don't believe that most reporters intentionally know what's going on when they report current affairs, so they depend on an already slighted view of the world based on the few who do know whats going on in their respective fields. As, you can see those with the deepest pockets are in a better position influence public opinion through these channels. So, Joe Shmoe, watching the evening news thinks he's getting legitimate news because someone he trust is telling him about it. Best intentions will damn us all, simply because no single person can be a expert on everything, so we depend on...err...experts to provide the correct perspective. PR firms provide this illusion of expert opinion and provide the media witht he information it needs to do it's job. So we are still dependant on a select few (relatively) to make the decisions that effect most of the workings of legislation. So, if you think about that relationship, you can see that even true democracy is an illusion. The only core difference being that those "experts" have to influence the general population into believing that what they say is best and does it without much effort. Something we take willingly as, if you remember, Joe Shmoe didn't have an opinion in the first place. Now he thinks that we should bomb Iraq into oblivion.</p>

        <p>Everyones favorite genious, Ben Stein from "Win Ben Stein's Money" has written a nice piece on <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=64&amp;e=3&amp;u=/fo/20021213/bs_fo/2002_12_how_to_ruin_american_enterprise">"How to Ruin American Enterprise"</a>. It's right on the money I'd say. An excellent critique of the social decline currently underway in the public at large. The part about the school system playing to the lowest common denomenator is the most important aspect I my opinion. But don't forget about the march of legal action that has all but frozen innovation for fear of lawsuits. It is always the "other guy" you know.</p>
        <p>Mass market public relations has caused become so well integrated into our society that we actually think that wev'e succeeded in gaining free will. A milestone for PR firms (read: propaganda). Finally the government has a public that is content with the things that they see in the media and society today. Oblivious to the fact that we are now only brainwashed from massive repetion and blindly follow the suggestions of those that have the capital to finance big money campains: it doesn't matter if it's a new SUV or war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Ben, you're my hero.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Using MoveableType with DHTML Javascript</h3>
        <p>As if you didn't know, <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">MoveableType</a> is the BOMB! Well, OK, maybe not that good. But it's what I use for my blog engine and it makes things much easier. As with most blog software that uses the BloogerAPI; it uses a template system to generate the webpage and manage content. Allowing you to focus on your sites news and articles instead of formatting each and every page. MoveableTypes system uses a proprietary system a little different than most. I like to think that it's a little bit easier to use and more flexible. The only problem is getting to know tag system and how it works. Using this system is really easy once you know the lingo, but how do you use the DHTML script to get that ubercool navigation bar?</p>
        <p>Here it is in all it's glory.<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          &lt;MTCategories&gt;

        Lovely isn't it. It probably provides a little more perspective on why I wrote the script the way I did. Notice the catlist class selector. That selector is the one that gets created in memory when the script loads. It doesn't reside in my CSS file. "Side" and "Sidetitle" are selectors in my CSS file. They actually control the style even when the script isn't running, provided your browser supports CSS. The granularity built in to this sytem makes for a very general way to control the visibilty of you sheet without recoding everytime you add or delete categories or otherwise change your navbar. Also of note is the way "catlist" holds the same value of the javascript perimeter allowing the script to find the correct "catlist" to hide or show.
        <p></p>
        <p>Nevertheless, this will display all your categories you have in your blog along with the last 5 entries in each. Well, that's about it for MT tags. Enjoy your new navigation bar.</p>

        <h3 class="title">DHTML via Javascript - A Collapsable Text Menu Tutorial</h3>
        <p>I've been trying to provide as much functionality to this site without making things too complicated for the user. As you can see the navigation bar on the main page has been updated. Clicking the "[+]" will expand the category now. I didn't like the long list of recent articles running down the page, but I wanted to provide a way to get a quick look at the various topics. Let me know what you think.</p>
        <p>Now you know what I've been doing for the past couple of days. That's right, I learned to program Javascript. I've never written a program before three days ago. It was hell, but I fully intend to make your's no where as hard as it was for me. Given the plethora of programming centric sites out there, you would think that it would be a simple deal to learn. At the very least, you should be able to get a few clear examples. And in fact you can, if you want to create useless programs that do nothing. The problem is that most sites either assume that you already now how to program in another language or that you know nothing about it. The latter being the worst because they want to walk you through that process step by step while you write junk programs meanwhile totally skirting the real concepts that you need to know.</p>
        <p>We won't do that here. If you're interested we'll delve right in.</p>
        <p>Writing a program is all about moving and changing objects. it's really simple and frustrating at the same time once you realize that fact. Other places you will read about object oriented programming and how it's like "the way" to program. Well yeah it is, but for a beginner, you will mostly need to concern your self with much lower level objects. I won't do the standard "what is an object" talk, but I will tell you it's all about the API. That is Application Programming Interface. I'll be doing most of the grunt work here and indeed most every program nowadays.</p>
        <p>For clarification, we'll only be talking about Javascript this time around. Why Javascript? Because it the easiest lang. that I've found yet. (And the most widespread for its use in DHTML and other web technologies) The most important thing you will need to know before you can begin is a few resources:</p>
        <p><a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/">Netscape DevEdge</a> - Good reference and documentation site.<br />
        <a href="http://www.w3c.org/DOM/">W3C DOM</a> - The W3C's Document Object Model Specification. It explains all the types and inheritance and interface properties.</p>
        <p>You have to do lots of research to understand what each of the DHTM interfaces do and how to use them. This is crucial to understanding what you are moving around inside the containers. But with out further ado, here is the full script used to control the navigation bar.<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          function catList(id){<br />
          a="+";<br />
          b="-";<br />
          i=document.getElementById(id);<br />
          dval=i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display;<br />
          t=i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(0).getElementsByTagName("a").item(0).firstChild;<br />
          if (dval=="block") {<br />
          dval="none";<br />
          t.nodeValue=t.nodeValue.replace(b,a);<br />
          }<br />
          else {<br />
          dval="block";<br />
          t.nodeValue=t.nodeValue.replace(a,b);<br />
          }<br />
          i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display=dval;<br />
          }<br />
          if (document.getElementById && document.createTextNode){<br />
          document.write('&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.catlist {display:none;}&lt;/style&gt;')<br />
          }<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        Purdy ain't it! I still can't believe I spent about 40 hours on this alone. Good thing is, it's reusable otherwise I would have to shoot myself.
        <p></p>
        <p>I only used W3C DOM specification interfaces to the script should work with any DOM2 browser. IE 5.5 and Netscape 4 qualify for most funtions and Mozilla is fuly qualified. Note:My implementation does not qualify as XHTML. I've used the tag to insert the Category name to provide a unique id for each instance. It doesn't qualify because the names have spaces and CSS id specification doesn't allow spaces in the id. I'll have to find a work around, but this will do for now. You can alternatively use a manual naming format. UPDATE: Although at this time the validation site is down, it should now validate. Dummy me, I forgot about the tag. It's numeric and provided the unique identifier that was needed. I'll post the code in a separate article. It's pretty nifty.</p>
        <p>Let the picking begin; starting with the top:<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          function catList(id){<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "function" - we use this to establish a command to call from the web page, i.e. from a link or button.<br />
        "catList" - This is the name of the function, I could have named it catNip for that matter.<br />
        "(id)" - This is part of the "catList" function. "id" is a variable used to transfer a value to an internal function. (See below) I use this to specify the collection of tags that I want to modify. On the navigation bar it's the category name.<br />
        Of course this is were those other tutorials come in handy, syntax. We need a bracket "{" to contain the function. Otherwise you get *gasp* a syntax error. (Whatever shall we do?)<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          a="+";<br />
          b="-";<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "a" - is a variable the equal (=) sign assigns the right hand value to the left hand side. Notice I wrote that before I used it in an expression later. Variables must be declared before they are used. "+" is going to be one of the characters is replace via a later expression.<br />
        "b" - the other value that I replace with "a".<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          i=document.getElementById(id);<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "i" - another variable that I use to transfer the contents to another container.<br />
        "document" - Hey, it one of the those interfaces in our API defined by the DOM. This container performs a generic operation. It finds and returns the current page in the browser window as an object. We use any function or parameter that can be access by the "document" interface. (See what I mean by research. Check out the W3C site for more information.)<br />
        "getElementById" - Finds and returns all tags (elements) with the #id matching our parameter "id". No quotes in () because this is a variable being specified. This one was specified earlier in the "function" parameter. You can use any text value for the function which is not always true as we sill see later.<br />
        ";" - used to delaminate the end of a line. More of that syntax stuff.<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          dval=i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display;<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "dval" - variable to hold the value for our CSS style being defined.<br />
        "i" - used to limit the expression to the contents of the specified ID.<br />
        "getElementsByTagName("div")" - another contained used to filter by a certain tag, in this case the "div" tag. This container returns a list of tags, not just a generic object.<br />
        "div" - The HTML tag to filter for.<br />
        "item(1)" - Index value to filer for in the list. Note: counting starts with 0 so in this case we will return the second tag in the list, by specifying "1".<br />
        "style" - Command used to perform a style definition on the object (tag).<br />
        "display" - type of styling that we want to do on this tag. This could be any CSS style definition.<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          t=i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(0).getElementsByTagName("a").item(0).firstChild;<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "t" - Varible need I say more.<br />
        "i" - You should know what this is by now.<br />
        "getElementsByTagName("div")" - See how easy this is.<br />
        "item(0)" - Return the first "div" tag.<br />
        "getElementsByTagName("a") - Return a list of "a" tags.<br />
        "item(0)" - Return first "a" tag.<br />
        "firstChild" - DOM interface return the first object matching our criteria. (Later it is defied by either the "+" or "-" in the varibles "a" or "b".)<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          if (dval=="block") {<br />
          dval="none";<br />
          t.nodeValue=t.nodeValue.replace(b,a);<br />
          }<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "if" - conditional statement that executes the contents only if the parameters are "true".<br />
        "(dval=="block")" - Parameter that returns true if the variable dval and "block" are equal. The "==" delaminate a true or false statement if both sides are equal.<br />
        "dval="none"" - sets the value of dval to "none" if this container is executed.<br />
        "t" - Umm, yeah....<br />
        "nodeValue" - returns the value as text instead of an [object]. Allows us to evaluate and execute the rest of the string.<br />
        "replace" - replaces the text per the parameters specified. This were we actually use those values for "a" and "b".<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          else {<br />
          dval="block";<br />
          t.nodeValue=t.nodeValue.replace(a,b);<br />
          }<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "else" - executes if no other conditiond have be met. This statement sets the value of dval to "block". It also replaces the text of "a" with "b".<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display=dval;<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        "i.getElementsByTagName("div").item(1).style.display=dval;" - Recursive statement. It makes a loop.<br />
        <blockquote>
          <br />
          if (document.getElementById && document.createTextNode){<br />
          document.write('&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.catlist {display:none;}&lt;/style&gt;')<br />
          }<br />
        </blockquote><br />
        Simply, this writes a style sheet in memory, to allow for a more responsive click. "catlist" is an CSS class selector specified in my webpage. It defaults the value of display to "none"; hiding the menu by default. Added side effect is if the script doesn't execute for whatever reason, the display will NOT hide the contents of the class. Therefore the category menu will always show the entries if the script is not run, a neat side effect for those older browsers.
        <p></p>
        <p>So lets look at the whole script. You click the hyperlink, the script looks at the document, finds the CSS id specified by the text in the hyperlink via the "id" variable, finds the second "div" tag, then sets the CSS display value for that CSS ID selector and sets it to hide or show the contents of the "catlist" class selector.<br />
        At the same time, it finds the document, the CSS id specified, the first "div" tag therein, the first "a" tag, the first character, and replaces the "+" sign with "-".</p>
        <p>So, there you have it. Copy it, paste it, do whatever you like. Fell free to *gasp* change it.</p>
        <p>I hope that was a bit more refreshing than the "other" programming tutorials on the web. If you still are having problems remember look in the documentation. The information there is much more useful and free of bloated oversimplified examples. Make sure you watch your syntax, watch for inheritance problems (if it doesn't explicitly say you can do something, most likely you can't without substantial reworking), and don't forget declare your variables before you use them.<br /></p>

        <h3 class="title">Will The RIAA See To It's own Demise?</h3>
        <p>The RIAA with all it spin doctoring and bogus claims have still yet to show any benefit for the music industry. <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20021216/0912254.shtml">TechDirt</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/28588.html">The Register</a> have reported on some of the evil organizations failed tactics to change public opinion. Despite all it's legal firepower, it has yet to show why it's "evidence" is valid. I <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1040056422.html">remember</a> reading an article about a recent raid that uncovered 420 or so cd burners, which after careful srutiny, amounted to ~150 high speed burners. Thats quite an exageration and the public at large is noticing, not to mention the legislature.</p>
        <p>Latest theory: The RIAA will colapse under it's own weight.</p>
        <p>I have a feeling that when everything is said and done. 5 or 10 years from now, there will be no public ear for the RIAA if they continue to push their bloated claims. I'm almost obliged to ignore all future RIAA press releases. Simply because to me their cries and moans are just the die throes of a mighty beast. I'm now fairly confident everything will work out in the end given time for the content industry to remodel their business model to a more progressive form. forget all the concern over user rights and piracy raising prices. They'll be short lived if they even happen at all. I have a feeling that RIAA won't last that long.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Web Freedom and Geek Synergy</h3>
        <p>Geeks are a different breed. It always seems as if everything we do is bent on taking power away from structure and to the individual. This is the power behind the blogging fad. P2P technologies are on the rise and promise a new era of digital freedom. One question: where the money?</p>
        <p>As the article <a href="http://salon.com/tech/col/rose/2002/12/13/supernova/index.html">suggests</a>, the "suits" obviously don't like this sort of model as it severely cuts profit potential when you can't control the supply, the conterpart to demand. Somehow out of all this decentralisation comes a new model of profit potential and it's one that, suprisingly enough, aimed squarly at the geek or individual. The profits are marginal, but everyone gets to share instead of a select few.</p>
        <p>Conversely, what happens when a "geek" does have a large profit potential. Sell out, or stick to your guns. Wired has <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/google_pr.html">an article</a> about Google rise to fame. As the key holder to the web, Google has a lot responsibility on their shoulders. Just what will happen when Google goes public. Could they possibly maintain their policy of "no evil" when share holders have different opinions as to just what "evil" means. Just how long can Google maintain a favorable opinion by it's users, whilest minimizing a legal battle against it's policys as more and more see it as a public utility. Google has done a good job so far, but some see Google's compromise to the DCMA, China government, and Scientology as a sign of cracks in the armor that is Google's trademark geeky values. I, for one, hope for the best for Google. I just wish people would just let technology be. People can be pretty ugly when trying to manipulate the system for personal gain. Some people just can't see a good thing when it's staring them in the face. But I guess that's just the humanist in me welling up; down boy.</p>

        <p>A while back I was cleaning up my bookmarks folder and found a long forgotten link. It was to an old comic "<a href="http://www.little-gamers.com/">Little Gamers</a>". I used to watch it religiously along with this one at <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade.</a> Ahh, the memories... I was very disappointed to find that the link was broken. I was very busy as I sometimes am with old junk when I'm cleaning. Somehow the thought completely slipped my mind to google it until I ran across <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com/">this</a>, which I thought had a striking graphic style. It caught my eye atleast. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the little thumb athletes as much as me.</p>

        <h3 class="title">100th Anniversary of Quantum Physics</h3>
        <p>Could someone please explain to me how it's been 100 years today from Dec 14, 1900? /. is <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/02/12/15/0235204.shtml?tid=99">reporting</a> that it's the 100th anniversary of QP, but the math still has eluded me. The discussion is worth mentioning; it's absolutely hilarious!</p>
        <p>Still it's hard to believe that QP has been going for so long. I wonder when the next revolution is going to start. Given our current rate of discovery, I wouldn't think that it should be too long until we have another theory to topple this one. Of course the new would have to topple not only QP, but the whole of the standard model. And somehow, I don't think it'll be accepted unless it incorporates the whole as one concise formula preferrably less than 3 inches in length. Kinda picky those physicists types...yep, real picky they are...</p>

        <h3 class="title">Blog Enlightenment</h3>
        <p>Web design can sometimes be a pain. The standards are always changing and you never knowif the end user is going to see your web page as you intended. There's also the concern that your site in not easily accessable to your readers because as time goes by it becomes increasingly difficult to manage your content and provide and easy to use interface for navigation. Often times this leads to frequent redesigns and/or useless features. I've most certainly been guilty of being overly insecure about my design/website in the past. I've also seen my share of doubts as to what I should post and what is better left to other sites to report. It's all to easy to forget about the mission or purpose of your site. Lesson #1 - It's one thing to write a mission statement; it's another to actually adhear to it.</p>
        <p>I've recently been learning about DHTML and I recently ran across a site that has some very useful (and easy to understand) tips on web design. The site is <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/main.html">A LIST APART</a>. I'm still reading through the site, but I ran a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/writeliving/">blogging article</a> with some disturbingly simple tips on how to write consistently and well. Hence, my little bit of self reflection. I hope you fellow bloggers out there find it useful. It was an eye opener for me.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Reflections on Japan</h3>
        <p>I often think about what it was like to live in Japan. I'm usually baffled at an explaination. It's on the tip of my tongue, but it still eludes me. Sometimes I'm asked, "What was it like to live there?", usually replying, "cool" or "incredible". It's like a fantasy world, were somehow Hello Kiity on dump trucks make sense and personal expression make new highs (and lows). I would say that it is "another world", but the would be horribly inadequate.</p>
        <p>So, I was reading v-2, and came across a <a href="http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=223">post</a> that reminded me of a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.09/gibson.html">Wired article</a> about Japan. I've yet to find anything that comes close to what it was like. These come terribly close however.</p>

        <h3 class="title">The Crystal Ball</h3>
        <p>Now here's a true revolutionary. <a title="ZDNet: Tech Update: Enterprise Hardware / The future of computer interfaces" href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2901050,00.html">Gartner</a>, once again make useless predictions about the future of computing. I swear, why do they even bother? Do people find this information useful. I mean it's not even bold, it's just, well...boring. No revolutionary claims, no bold statements to distinguish it from the pack of other conservatives like themselves. Where's the vision, man.</p>
        <p>I have a few disagreements I'd like to point out. (1) Ok, so the CRT is on the way out the door; no brainer there. Also, people have been touting speak synthesis for, like um, forever. I don't see it being used in any copacity other that what it is used for now: the disabled. Does anyone out there care to have there spam read out loud with some fake computerized voice while driving down the road? I know I don't. However I do see electronic paper taking off once it become available. The prediction that computers are going to assume an obiquitous role in our daily lives is hardly a new statement.<br />
        (2) The concept of a digital avatar metephor API for personalized computing is far from new. I can go to Yahoo or Amazon to demonstrate that. I do agree that speech and handwriting reconition will greatly improve. However, I don't think that we will be still using the keyboard and mouse as a primary interface. There is just too much research on other input methods. I'm not too sure when we'll have Brain-Machine interfaces, but I don't think that they are to far off considering the success of current research into the technology and the soon to come nanotech revolution. Yes, it will be a revolution, but thats another post altogether.<br />
        (3) I pretty much agree on the third prediction though it's rather obvious. It where we've been moving ever since the internet exposed a need for better data management and querying (preferably) against a personal profile of information (avatar, once again). Standarization will "hopefully" improve a lot of things in the computing realm.</p>
        <p>So, there you go. Now all there's left to do is check back here in a few years and see if my all too vague critisms hold up.</p>

It'll be nowhere near as good as the Leonid showers, but it sould be worth your time. Provided your in the northern hemisphere, as I don't know how it'll be in Japan or Australia. I hate having missed the Leonids because of bad weather, but the weather is clear here now. So, hopefully, I'll be a very cold person coming morning. I guess I'll have to remember the coffee.</p>

        <p>MIT has had a pilot program open for a while to their plan is to release all their course materials online.It's called <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">OpenCourseWare</a>. All the materials are free of charge and reflect the current curriculum being offered to students. They opened the program back in September, but at the moment the selection is pretty slim. Recently, one of my friends pointed me back in that direction again. This time I noticed some flash, shockwave, and java <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/global/department8.html">simulations</a> offered in their physics department. Check out the 8.02-Electricity and Magnetism Course.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Relief for Your Computing Obsession</h3>
        <p>Anybody who spends a signifigant time behind the computer will agree that often times it can be painful. Many people that spend thier waking hours typing on the keyboard have found that they start losing feeling in their hands and start experiencing pains away from the computer. Common tasks like opening a door become a dreaded affair because of the painful effect. Carpal Tunnet Syndrome (CTS) has gotten plenty of meadia attention. Still many don't know why they are experiencing pain, although there are many effective and inexpensive treatments that could aleviate most of the symptoms. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars</a> has a review up about the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1039505698.html">IMAK Smart Glove</a>, a product to help protect your wrist from further injury while allowing them to heal.</p>
        <p>Many people have this problem, but a few have a different problem called Cubital Tunnel Syndrom. The main difference in symptoms is that the numbness primarily occurs on the ring and pinky finger. It is caused by inflamation on a nerve that travels through the elbow as apposed to the wrist. The most effective treatment is simple to not rest your elbow on anything to relieve the pressure and inflamation. Along with freaquent breaks, many see full recovery.</p>
        <p>I can testify to it simply because I have this problem. When at it's worst I could hardly use my right hand for anything, it was simply to weak and the pain was unbearable. I had tried all the techniques for relief for CTS, but they weren't effective. I finally went to the doctor and he informed me of CuTS. It took me a while to get used to not resting my elbow as I typed, but after a while I became more aware of my elbow position. I also took frequent breaks away from the keyboard to straighten my arm. After about 3 weeks my pain went away and, after about 3 months, I recieved full feeling back to my hand. There is relief to these problems, but it requires a little change to your routine. The change was well worth it though. Don't forget to talk to your doctor about it.</p>

          At the Toys "R" Us in San Francisco recently, Mia Singletary was shopping with her mother, eyeing the Barbie Travel Train. The inevitable question arose: "Would you use this train to steal lots of intellectual property?"<br />
          At first, she didn't answer, almost as if she didn't understand the question. But then she smiled.<br />
          "Yes!" she said, bouncing on her toes, as her pigtails bobbed.<br />
          "And how exactly would you use it to steal intellectual property?" she was asked.<br />
          "I would buy it," she said. Her logic wasn't tracking. Was she realizing that she had been totally busted?<br />

Whatever that's supposed to mean. Sorry guy's, but I'm gonna keep broadbasting my beacon for all the world to see. Yep, I'm completely sold on the idea that a terrorist is going to use my 802 for launching a DoS that will take down the entire internet in the most strategic attack EVAR. He he.. Hey, HS I got some beachfront property in Arizona I'd like to sell you too. These guys are idiots. AS IF....</p>
        <p>These guys need to keep it up. I need a few laughs like that everyday. Who knows, if they keep it up, everyone you know will be considered a terrorist. Your mom, Uncle Joe,....that strange guy at the convience store that smells like mothballs......your dog....on second thought the mothball king is pretty strange.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Intelectual Propery Rights - The Open Source Argument: Is It Valid?</h3>
        <p>With all the fuss about IP rights and abuses, one can be lost in a sea of arguments and litigation. I saw an link to an <a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=02/11/30/050236">article</a> on /. about the role copyright law should have on software code. The author examines the Open Source movement and GNU GLP license schemes and possible impact on future copyright laws. It's an intresting debate, but I'm completely lost as to which way to go.</p>
        <p>Should copyright law be applicable to software? If so, what protections will foster innovation and spur growth without being overly intrusive? Just how much say should an author have in what is done with his "propery". I, like the author, believe that intrusion into the "private shere" will only bring about enraged citizens. And further inhibit constructive mechanisms for protections.</p>
        <p>I believe thats the main reason most people are outraged about the latest efforts by the music industy and hollywood to thwart pirating. I think of it as priciple. I shouldn't be subject to scrutiny and person invasion by these corporations because they hold copyrights. Since when does IP law supercede the right to privacy? So, I see the privacy sphere argument a valid one. Will it win through to the end? No, I think not. The economic argument will win the hearts of our congress. Who seem partial to the belief that a good economy is the heart of America and that what is good for the stock market is good for democracy. On another note, I can't see any way to protect the rights of an author and allow for the privacy of individuals in the digital age. But one thing seems clear: I see why Microsoft has thus far steered clear from the debate. Leaving enforment and regulation to vendors and only providing a frame work ala Palladium.</p>

        <p>I posted previously about wearable computers and obiquitous computers, but I've found a few other articles on the web to further expand on that subject. <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/mithril/index.html">This one</a> here from the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT media</a> lab with schematics and other paraphernalia to build your own Linux powered <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/index.html">wearable computer</a>.

        <h3 class="title">SETI To Go Active In 2003</h3>
        <p>SETI (Search for ExTraterestrial Intelligence) has <a href="http://www.planetary.org/html/UPDATES/seti/SETI@home/Update_120402.html">announced</a> plans to actively search for signals next year. SETI is a project to search for electromagnetic (and more recently laser/lightwave) communication from distant planets. It has compiled a list of the most promising sources Top 100 style. They plan to revisit those sites and complete an more extensive search. This is a departure from SETI's usually passive listening techniques whereby they just listen in whatever direction the radio telescope happens to be pointing. Maybe it'll prove more successful than to a previous project to relocate the source of that elusive <a href="http://www.planetary.org/html/news/articlearchive/headlines/2002/Wow2.html">WOW!</a> signal received in 1977 and prompted a Senator to cut NASA funding for the SETI project. I never new <a href="http://www.planetary.org/html/UPDATES/seti/seti-history.html">Spielberg</a> was a SETI supporter.</p>
        <p>BTW, he's got a new <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/02/apontv.spielbergs.taken.ap/index.html">miniseries</a> on SciFi channel for those that care. I haven't seen it (I don't watch much TV.), but I'm quite sure it's good. I swear everything he touches is golden. And before all the movie buffs start flaming me, let me say that I'm NOT a movie buff. So, I'm entitled to my ignorance, and infact, I gloat in it. Yes, I loved A.I.</p>

        <p>Shanghai, China - <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993153">Engineers</a> have built the world first maglev passenger train. It will be used to transport passengers from Pudong Internation Airport and Shanghai's financial district covering 30 Km in 7 minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, No matter how you look at it that's fast. In testing the train reached a speed of 312 mph, but the passenger version will travel at 250 mph. Remember this a train, not a car or plane, a train. You know, those big hulking beasts. And this one can go nearly half the speed of sound! That's simply amazing.</p>
        <p>Also in other news, our good friends across the Pacific have worked out Pi to an unprecedented accuracy: 1.24 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-2223732,00.html">Trreellleeoonn</a> places. The previous record was 158 billion places. Mind-blowing!</p>

        <h3 class="title">And You Thought Ubiquitous Computing Was Dead</h3>
        <p>Anyone reading computer news about 2 years ago was bound to have read something about "ubiquitous computing" or "pervasive computing". I can't say that I was sad to stop hearing about it in the news. It was everywhere; everyone was so excited about it and what it was going to do for computers. A new paradigm they said. Well, finally, after many months, the fad faded away and settled into mediocrity. A bygone era of naive optimism.</p>
        <p>I'm supposed to be wearing an internet enabled pair of shoes right now, and my jacket lining is supposed to be a display. Were did it all go? What happened, surely this wasn't just another hopeless expression of geek-so-shiek technolust. Did everything have to go with the dot-com bust?</p>
        <p>Most assuredly not! It simply faded into the background where it was supposed to be in the first place. Slowly and quietly web services were rolled out to facilitate everyday functions such as news reading (XML::RDF::RSS). Along with a whole slew of other Web API's to facilitate application integration with the web and further contribute to the ideal that is the semantic web. The hardware is slowly becoming portable, powerful, and efficient enough to allow better integration.</p>
        <p>But where does that leave us? Why haven't we seen more of this technology? It leaves us right where we are right now. Obiquitous computing never promised sexy new gadgets or technologies. Cut though all the hype that was so prevalent and you see a new picture. One where you don't see computers and yet they still work for you. One that doesn't require a BS degree in computer science to operate. That was the promise.</p>
        <p>With that said; I don't think we have arrived, but we have indeed started the journey. We have much to learn on the way. But the infrastructure is being built. Wireless networks (wLAN), via 802.11, are become more common even in daily life. We'll soon have "personal area networks" (PAN), via bluetooth, and with that we have constant connectivity.</p>
        <p>The final piece of the puzzle is the software which will enable all the technologies to be useful. Such as the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/wo_Rheingold120402.asp">software</a> that this guy is working on. Social networks are the most valuable resource for people and with some innovation and perseverance; maybe well have something that truly expands and enriches our lives. Only time will tell, but something tells me; <a href="http://www.unfinishedrevolution.com/">Michael Dertouzos</a>, who spear headed the <a href="http://www.oxygen.lcs.mit.edu/">Oxygen</a> Project, would be proud.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Lazy Ass Nitrogen Atoms; perhaps they need a little caffeine</h3>
        <p>Atoms and their particles are alway changing and interacting in a web of hyperactivity. Not these though. Some scientist have been <a href="http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/2002/split/616-2.html">observing</a> nitrogen atoms floating around in the aftermath of a dying star. The resulting low density vacuum has left a void of inactivity for these guys to find the slackers, located in the NGC3918 a planetary nubula. The slothy nitrogen was found to have lifetime of 2500 seconds. That's like eternity in atomic terms. Search me, what this is supposed to mean for astrophysics, but something tells me that It's really important. Especially since it took 3 people to come up with the measurements.</p>
        <p>No, really this could have uses in coaxing atomic systems into more stable, longer lived states. Which would be exceedingly handy when designing longer lived entanglment preceedures. Who knows maybe one day you'll be able to talk to your fiance from across the galaxy using fast than light communication built off of the resilient processes displayed by these atoms. Hey, not to mention slower refresh rate for quantum memory. I'd suck if you had this nice new quantum computer but couldn't get anything dome on it, because it was having to refresh its calculations more than it was able to actually find the solution. Decoherence is a bitch!</p>

        <h3 class="title">Quantum Computing Primer</h3>
        <p>You didn't think I missed all the fuss being made on the news about the recent developments in quantum computers did you? No, I just thought that the subject deserved a bit more than the usual go <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993114">here</a> read <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1038887645.html">this</a> link up. Although most sites did a good job of getting the word out, most didn't explain some the questions that many readers had about the field in general.</p>
        <p>So what, praytell, is all the fuss about? What is a "quantum" computer? What in 'tarnation is decoherence? How does that involve me? Why should I be excited.</p>
        <p>A quantum computer (QC) is a computer that operates on the principles and "weirdness" of quantum physics. Quantum processes are very strange in that they any given "particle" that interacts with another exists in a "superposition" of states until measured. Sort of like, and this is stretching it, say someone knocks on your door at your home and you go to answer it. Well, until you open the door and the person sees you; you (to the person that knocked on the door) are in a "superposition" of states: "home" or "not home". Only until you open the door or otherwise give indication that you are indeed "home" or not, you are BOTH "home" and "not home" and NOT "home" and "not home". (yes, you read that right) You will exist in this "superposition" until the knocker observes you (or not) by opening the door. When you are (or, again, not) observed it is known as a "collapse of the wave function" ( It's long story, but I'll cover it in another article.) Ludicrous, huh! Well that's a very vague and liberal explanation. But like it or not, that's quantum mechanics (QM). So, on with the story.</p>
        <p>It was Richard P. Feynman who was one of the first to realize that this "superposition" stuff could be very powerful in solving very complex problems where many separate variables were involved. Such as the directed Hamiltonian Path (HP) problem otherwise known as "the traveling salesman" problem. The problem involves a salesman traveling through a number of cities and only visiting them once. The problem is very easy to begin with until the number of cities he has to visit goes up. Until the problem becomes so complex that it is impractical to solve with even the fastest super computers. The problem is complex because it involves so many variables and only one solution. The only way to find out which path to take is to use "trial and error". And miscalculation along the way will lead the solution "down the wrong path" so to speak and you must start all the way over from the beginning and try another route.</p>
        <p>Why does a QC have an advantage. Lets go back to that "superposition" mumbo jumbo. QM says that any "particle" (electron, photon, etc.) that interacts with another can become "entangled" with each other. Entanglement means that when something happens to one particle it's entangle partner undergoes the same interaction. No matter how far apart they are. This is interesting because a QC designer could use this to perform many calculations at once. With each calculation knowing what the other is doing.</p>
        <p>That's all fine and well, but just how does a designer even make a QC, even in principle. First, he needs a building block. In traditional computers that building block is the transistor with that the designer can represent 1's and 0's as is convention on modern computer systems today. The QC equivalent of this would be the "qubit". With it we will build our computer in a fashion conceptually similar to convetional computers. The major differences would be manufacturing techniques used and programming methods.</p>
        <p>Herein lies the signifigance of the latest developements. Most promenent is that of the difficulties of building the physical device. The UNSW device spearheaded by <a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/STAFF/ACADEMIC/clark.html">Richard Clark</a> was based on a design from back in 1998 by the mastermind Bruce Cane of the <a href="http://www.physics.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>. Whereby two phosphorus atoms were embedded in a silicon crystal. Phosphorous atom were used because they have a slightly better fortitude when it comes to "decoherence", wereby the atom stop behaving in the way need to have the quantum effect. The reason that this development is such good news is that it has proven feasable the ability to build a quantum mechanical device on a silicon substrate. Similar to conventional computer chip manufaturing techniques. Which greatly increases the ease to which it is integrated with mainstream computing. The task was difficult because of the extremely small distances involved, because the phosphorus atoms had to be placed ~20nm from each other. For comparison standard chip manufacturers are using a 130nm process and that's considered the bleeding edge. The researchers actually acheived ~4nm! So, needless to say, the process they used was very ingenious.</p>
        <p>But, back to our computer. Say I enter a HP problem into our hypothetical QC. When the computer calculates the problem it first "entangles" as many qubits as is needed and instead of solving each route one by one. It solves them all at once! So now we have a whole array of qubits one of which holds our correct answer and just how do we go about finding it. Well, one of our more observative readers might say something like; "But doesn't reading one of the qbits collapse the wave function and if we read the wrong one we just lost the information". Yes and no, It does collapse the wave function, but since all the qubits are entangled when we read wrong (or right for that matter) qubit we don't get the solution to that single qubit's calculation. "How's that?", you say. Simple, when we read the result, because all the qubits are entengled, all the qubits' wave functions collapse and we get the average solution that the WHOLE system came to, as per QM. Hmm, just what are we going to do with this average when we only need the correct solution of one tiny insignificant qubit? Hehe...The kicker is that the single correct qubit's solution and the entire system average's solution are one and the same. So, instead of having to do multiple operations to find one solution, we did one operation to find many solutions, but the solutions are equivalent. And QM tells us that the larger the system (the more qubits involved) the more accurate it is. Behold the power of QC.</p>
        <p>So now we come to our last little piece of news. The significance of which is that this is the first time anyone has made a computation using quantum techniques on a systems proven to be in a quantum state. (that's a mouthful) The computation was carried out by <a href="http://www.lsr.ph.ic.ac.uk/">Innsbruck University</a> and involved an operation to decided whether or not a coin was the same or different on each side. It sounds simple (and it is), but the calculations were carried out on both sides at once, utilizing quantum techniques to complete the calculation twice as fast as a conventional computer calculation; again proving the feasability and power of QC.</p>
        <p>On another note not directly related (and a bit old), researchers have observed entangled photons remaining <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992564">entangled</a> even after passing through a barrier, interacting with another object, something not previously thought possible. Because it was thought that interaction with other objects caused the englement effect to disperse. This proves that the effect is much more resilient than previously thought. It could and probably will have tremendous implications on encryption and communication technologies, given further experimentation. I still think this holds the key to faster than light communication, but I'm probably just ignorant.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure this should even be a "Technology Journal" at all. It's seems that I'm off topic as much as I'm on. Alas, It's my blog so I'll do what I want. (damnit!) hehe. Well since I've obviously commited another of these sins, perhaps I sould share with you why. Yes, I think I shall.</p>
        <p>I've been reading <a href="http://v-2.org/index.php">v-2 Organisation</a>. I'm not exactly sure why, but I have despite a rather unlikely marrage of architural critique and prada fetish <a href="http://v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=21">contained</a> therein. And let us not forget to mention the logical and obligatory robot <a href="http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=215">discussion</a>. As if you couldn't tell; I like this page, although I'm not sure I share his passion for <a href="http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=212">fonts</a>. Not to metion I just wish I had the same eye for site design, but you can't have eveything can you. I'll be adding this lovely piece of heaven to daily rotation and I recommend you do the same.</p>
        <p>Now how do I carry over the general site design and feel with out totally ripping it off. I'll have to work on that one. Ack! Another project in my overly fragmented schedule.</p>

        <p>Sorry for not posting today. The internet has been really slow today. So, I haven't been able to get around very well today to get the news. It's really frustrating, and I hopefully it'll clear up soon. I've also been trying to download the Sun java IDE. I've yet to get a download speed faster than 1KB. Eww, this is driving me crazy. I'm tired of these servers not giving me the time of day, because I'm on dialup. I hope you all enjoy your broadband connections...NOT! LOL</p>
        <p>//me waits in restless anticipation for my satellite connection.</p>

        <p>Testing once again. This time with <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">Newz Crawler</a>. I found it by looking for a RSS new reader. I just couldn't believe it was so hard to find a 3 panel outlook style RSS new reader. I mean come on! Sometimes these programmer types are pretty dense when it come to UI's and aesthetics. I thought it reasonably obvious for someone to read news this way. It's only logical to be able to select your feed, see a list of news items on that feed, and have a preview pane to see the full description.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, I'm in love with this news app. It's a welcome departure from the usual "scroll forever because all the feeds are displayed in one long list" type of readers that seem to be so predominate as of late.</p>
        <p>It also includes a blogging client. The one I'm posting with right now.</p>
        <p>The previous post was done with <a href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.Bloggar</a>. Which is a blogging client only. I'll be evaluating both over the next few days. I do have one beef already though. Newz Crawler isn't free, which severly inhibits my choices. Simple because I don't have a Job, so no steady income for me. My luck I'll end up loving it and can't live without it. We'll see.</p>

        <p>It seems that my site is a stopping point along the way to the <a title="Welcome to The Stone" href="http://commons.thestone.com/">Enigma</a>! Numerous referals have been recorded in my server logs of people coming from this site. My best guess is that they are playing that internet game. The game is a mystery that you solve by using the internet to research with each mystery providing a clue to the "Enigma". What that is I don't know, but I did do one of the puzzles. Mine was on the Chupacabras. Of course, I didn't know that when I started though, but it was pretty easy to figure out.</p>
        <p>The site was pretty freaky though. When I first got there I thought it was some kind of "new age" site. The site is still a little unnerving though, why I don't know. Kind of reminds me of that whole Blair Witch stuff a few years back.</p>

        <p>More reasons to try for that 250,000 Feynman prize. If these people keep it up well have nanotechnology equivalants to every cell function in the body. But I guess that the plan, huh? Not that it a bad thing.</p>
        <p>The strange thing is that these devices consume less energy than there repective biological equivelants. Go figure.</p>

        <p>I reported earlier on these, but now I've found the full proposal by the Foresight Institue. If you remember, these devices are a proposed red blood cell replacement/augment. The proposal, which at first seems preposterous, now looks very promising. All that is left to is find a manufacturing technique for sizes so small. As if that was easy, right!</p>
        <p>Hmm, I wonder if these would obsolve the need for SCUBA apperatus. It'd be delightful if these could eliminate the"bends". Just imagine going swimming underwater for 4 hours without ever taking a breath. You'd probably need some way of reading your respirocytes oxygen content before you could do that safely though. I'd suck if you forgot to take a deep enough breath and expecteed the full 4 hours worth only to find out otherwise; 70 meters below the surface!</p>

        <p>Here's an intresting article on some possible solutions to a possible money counterfeiting problem in the wake of nanotechnology. The problem under scrutiny is that if you can easily manipulate the very atoms and molecules of everyday objects; what's going to stop someone from creating perfect counterfeit currency?

        <h3 class="title">Argument for free market bandwidth alocation</h3>Forbes is running a piece on bandwidth concerns and the absurdity of the problem. The quote pretty much sums up the problem.<br />
        <br />
        <blockquote>
          The military's stance strikes many radio engineers as silly. While the FCC can stop Americans from transmitting on certain frequencies at home, it can't control what happens overseas, where wars tend to be fought. The spectrum most of the world will use for next-generation cell phones, for instance, is spectrum the military insists on keeping to itself in the U.S.
        </blockquote><br />
        <br />
        The problem is that most of the spectum is not being used and that which is being sold at artificially exorbant prices. Coupled that with the fact that no one "owns" a spectrum, and so how can someone claim to have a right to a certain spectrum. Obviously, the most adamant detractors are those that didn't even pay a dime for their part of the spectrum. A TV media mogul in the article even has the audacity to claim that it's a right for someone to make money of being lucky, or that somehow his broadcasting rights somehow came out of "hard work".<br />
        <br />
        Yes, I'm sure you worked really hard to obtain a right to a free (public domain) airwave spectrum.<br />
        <br />
        This pisses me off. maybe I should just stop reading cause lately everything has been making upset. I need to just go hide in a closet, then maybe, I won't have such a problem.

        <p>The cloning grand master is at it <a title="Independent News" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_medical/story.jsp?story=355574">again</a>. This time he wants to create stems cells off of human egg cells. He's seeking a government license before he can start research. He wants to use a proceedure called parthenogenesis to stimulate egg cells in to unfertilized embryo's. Stem cells are very intresting because they lack any of the function specific "optimizations" that fully developed cells have. (heart muscle, bone marrow, brain matter and such) It is hoped that(if they find a way to reverse the process) stem cells could provide tissue that would not be subject to rejection from the new transplant host. Among many other posible uses for stem cells.</p>
        <p>On another note, I'd love to have a clone of my self. I could teach myself all the things that I should have learned the first time around. I'd be the quinesntial oracle as to what is going to happen to his body as it developes. Such as when I was growing up I had a hard time dealing with how skinny I was and dealing with my extremely long legs. I'd already have it figured out how he should deal with that situation. No more wasted time trying to figure out his strength and weeknesses. Just plenty of time to improve even further on those strengths.</p>
        <p>Well, I think it would be cool; freaky, yes, but still cool all the same.</p>

        <h3 class="title">DoE and Artifcial sight team up</h3>
        <p>The Department of Energy has commited to contibuting $3 million over 3 years to <a title="Office of Science - Feature Articles - Artificial Retina Project" href="http://www.science.doe.gov/feature_articles_2002/November/Artificial_Retina/PF_Artificial-Retina.htm">artificial retina research</a>.</p>
        <p>An artificial retina works by implanting an electrode array on the back of the eye to stimulate the nerves that carry the signals the brain where it is processed to produce the images we see everyday. This has been done before in limited form, usually consisting only a few (~16) electrodes, to allow a patient with retinal disease to see the presence or absence of light. Plans to use more (~1000) electrodes will allow a person to see images; albiet in a very limited form.</p>
        <p>I can't wait to get an enhancment implant. I would love to be able to see in the dark or see light out of the visual spectrum. I know that to that would require a way to represent the extra information (other wavelengths outside the visible), as our brains don't readily process those spectrums, but I'm sure someone will figure it out.</p>
        <p>I suppose it'll be a while before the technology is refined enough to allow for aesthetic motivations, but it'll come one day. I'll be first in line, of course along with my memory implant too.</p>
