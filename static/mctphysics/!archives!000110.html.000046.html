        <h3 class="title">Michael Moore Gets Searched By The Secret Service</h3>
        <p>Well, that's a grabber headline if I ever heard one. To clarify this was not the THE Michael Moore of Columbine fame, but a Vietnam vet in <a href="http://www.sianews.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=458">North Carolina.</a> Just another example of the someone who made "the list". Hmm..maybe I can make "the list" too. The article goes on to talk about the whole incident and speculate on everyone favorite indepenant film maker's response. One more reason, to be all the more suspicious of our governments intentions.</p>
        <p>I noted earlier that propaganda leads our society by sheer force of repetition. I'd have to clarify the problem that I see as the most crucial. Democracy depends on each individual to have an opinion and stating it. Nowadays, even the most educated and opinionated person doesn't have an opinion on all the topics faced in our society today. So, the problem lies with our inherent limitation to be able to make a judgement on issues that show up on TV and other media outlets. I don't believe that most reporters intentionally know what's going on when they report current affairs, so they depend on an already slighted view of the world based on the few who do know whats going on in their respective fields. As, you can see those with the deepest pockets are in a better position influence public opinion through these channels. So, Joe Shmoe, watching the evening news thinks he's getting legitimate news because someone he trust is telling him about it. Best intentions will damn us all, simply because no single person can be a expert on everything, so we depend on...err...experts to provide the correct perspective. PR firms provide this illusion of expert opinion and provide the media witht he information it needs to do it's job. So we are still dependant on a select few (relatively) to make the decisions that effect most of the workings of legislation. So, if you think about that relationship, you can see that even true democracy is an illusion. The only core difference being that those "experts" have to influence the general population into believing that what they say is best and does it without much effort. Something we take willingly as, if you remember, Joe Shmoe didn't have an opinion in the first place. Now he thinks that we should bomb Iraq into oblivion.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at December 21, 2002 07:14 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=110" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
