        <h3 class="title">Creepy day</h3>
        <p>My favorite holiday of the year is now here. I can't wait to go see the new haunted houses this evening. Goblins, witches, mummies and ghosts all will be out and what better way to celebrate than to go out and enjoy the night. This is gonna be so much fun.</p>
        <p>Sorry for not posting in a while. I just can't stand working on this laptop, so I haven't been online in a while. Also I got some other things going on that require a little more of my time lately. But rest assured that I will soon be back in all my posting glory, ready to bewitch the masses with my unsatiable appetite for technology and science. "The Proving Grounds" will finally have graduated to a more fitting title. For those wondering, "The Proving Grounds" is only a temporary name. First there was "The Testing Grounds", a sort of Alpha test. Then came the current name which is a Beta test. And soon, I will give it it's final and permanent name, and the transition will be complete. Now all I "gots" to do is figure out what name that will be. Time will tell, and I'm in no hurry.</p>

        <p>It's always fun to wake up in the morning, smell the fresh morning dew, and think about what new and exciting thing are going to happen today.</p>
        <p>I didn't get to do that yesterday morning. I was too busy rushing to the power switch on my computer and ripping the case off to enjoy anything! Sometime early yesterday morning, the fans on my power supply went out and slowly roasted the internals of my PS. So what, big deal, replace the PS; you say. Well, replace the power supply I did. And, low and behold, I find out that; not only did the PS die a slow, and agonizing death. During it's last moments of pain, it decided to take my motherboard with it.</p>
        <p>So, I'm without my pride and joy, for what looks like a couple of weeks. Tyan seems to think I won't mind not having my computer for 2-3 weeks while they inspect the board, take it on a road trip, out to a nice dinner and a picnic in the park. Whilest I suffer the indignety that is laptop computing. I'm beginning to think I will not be buying Tyan again. Oh, and they want me to pay for shipping it to them.</p>

        <p><a title="404 Research Lab" href="http://www.plinko.net/404/">404 Research Labs</a> has an excellent resource on 404 errors and customization. Along with other errors, they explain the causes, symtoms and solutions to the legendary document and they're funny too. No really, check it out.</p>

        <p>I've been working on tweaking the site layout and found some interesting information on "skinning" websites. Apparently it's all the rage with "the kiddies". I think it's useful nonetheless. This link is to a site that has a rather nice collection of "skins" and a tutorial on implementing them in MT with PHP.</p>

        <p>I've finally got Moveable Type working something like I want. The domain finally propagated enough to let me implement MT correctly. Now I just have some minor changes planed, but they're mostly asthetic in nature. Now that thinks are running smoothly I can focus on other thing. I still have a lot planned for this site though.</p>
        <p>Still, I can't adequately say how satisfied I am with MT. There is now a special place in my heart for the design and programming team.</p>

        <p>I received a letter from MIT today. They sent me the name of my interviewer. I originally thought I wasn't going to get one, because so few people from Mississippi go to MIT. Needless to say I was relieved. I started thinking about how I was going to contact them and setup me interview. Only problem is, she lives in Vicksburg, so it'll be a long drive for one of us. Not to mention, I don't have a way to get there without someone taking me. Now all I got to do is concentrate on my SAT coming up on Nov and Dec.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Confused as always</h3>
        <p>I've been wanting to add news feeds to my site, but I can't seem to find any clear answers. I'm trying to use RDF-RSS for my news feeds, but I don't know how to program, so nearly all the info I can find on the web is completely useless to me. As my site is completely personal, I can't justify paying for hosting, so I can use scripts on my site. Maybe there is a way to use client-side scripts (?) to do what I want. I have the links that I need to grab the feeds, but I don't know the how to use PHP, ASP, whatevers. Nor do I know if I can use them on this server. Damn programmers and their elitest lingo.</p>
        <p>No!, let us not relinquish our divine knowledge to the infidels. Lest we undermine our superiority and again become social outcast anew. So sayeth the wise uNiXia.</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, I went to the coast (Gulf Shores) last weekend. I got to see my sister, who lives in Greenville, SC, which was quite a treat. "Cruising the Coast" was going on, so I got a unhealthy dose of classic American iron. It was great. I took lots of pictures, and worked on my otherwise imaculate photography skills (not). I'm really starting to hate my current camera, but I'll stick with it a little longer just so I can be sure that It's not me who sucks.</p>
        <p>Other news, from various soures, and shall remain undisclosed in the forseeable future, have reported that Corey is still in his room, hypnotized by the computer screen and otherwise waisting away.</p>

        <p>On the same token as my previous post. Further <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/wo_cameron021502.asp">developments</a> have come about. Near immediate applications range from powered superman suits to prosthetics.</p>

        <p>Let me try this again. I'm still losing my work to VB errors, but there's nothing I can do until Blogger fixes their code. Excepting perhaps copying my work before I post.</p>
        <p>I read an article from <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=00065FEA-DAEA-1D80-90FB809EC5880000">Scientific America</a> (courtesy Ars Technica) about a cybernetic money of all things. This brings all manner of thougjts into my head. Not the least of which is what something like this would do to my fragging ability. I'm pretty sure this would put me into the uber-L33t class.</p>
        <p>It also reminds my of some stuff I read by <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/">Raymond Kurzweil</a> about "spiritual machines", brain-machine interfaces and other futuristic concepts. It's interesting to think of a day when human communication trancends to level where we can communicate whole ideas and concepts instead of beating around the bush with words and mathematics like we do now. Sorry for those of you that subscribe to the <i>Star Trek</i> "Federation" future, but I find certain aspects of "The Borg" much more appealing. Were's my nightvision enhanced eye implant...</p>

        <p>Damn, now I'm royally pissed (royally?? What does that mean?). I spent about 20 minutes on a post and went to publish...*bam* VB error. Ewwww, that shit gets me all upset. It reminds me of the time I couldn't email with yahoo for like a month 'cause I kept getting a logon error every time I would send an email. I'll post later....maybe this'll work. *crossed fingers*</p>
