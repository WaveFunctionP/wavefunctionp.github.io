        <p>Atoms and their particles are alway changing and interacting in a web of hyperactivity. Not these though. Some scientist have been <a href="http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/2002/split/616-2.html">observing</a> nitrogen atoms floating around in the aftermath of a dying star. The resulting low density vacuum has left a void of inactivity for these guys to find the slackers, located in the NGC3918 a planetary nubula. The slothy nitrogen was found to have lifetime of 2500 seconds. That's like eternity in atomic terms. Search me, what this is supposed to mean for astrophysics, but something tells me that It's really important. Especially since it took 3 people to come up with the measurements.</p>
        <p>No, really this could have uses in coaxing atomic systems into more stable, longer lived states. Which would be exceedingly handy when designing longer lived entanglment preceedures. Who knows maybe one day you'll be able to talk to your fiance from across the galaxy using fast than light communication built off of the resilient processes displayed by these atoms. Hey, not to mention slower refresh rate for quantum memory. I'd suck if you had this nice new quantum computer but couldn't get anything dome on it, because it was having to refresh its calculations more than it was able to actually find the solution. Decoherence is a bitch!</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at December 5, 2002 08:50 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=81" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
