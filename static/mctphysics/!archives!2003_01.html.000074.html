        <h3 class="title">Evercrack</h3>
        <p>I've recently discovered <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">Everquest.</a> I know it's been out forever, but I've never played it or even seen someone who played it. Well, needless to say, I've developed an addiction. A very welcome one at that, as now I don't have to spend countless hours on the net scouring for some bit of needless news to satisfy my boredom. I don't expect I'll stop posting here, but the frequency will probably fade maybe about 2 or 3 times a week. So ever little halfway interesting news item won't be posted now. I'll only be posting the things I really have something to say about and that which is I find very interesting. Till then, I can be found on EQ, Vazelle, as Athenu or Aeriwen, my lovely level 5 Barbarian Figher and level 16 wood Elf Druid, respectively. Yes, it's totally nerdy, but definitely fun. Evercrack indeed!</p>

        <h3 class="title">Slow News</h3>
        <p>Hopefully I'm not the only one wondering why the news has been so slow lately. Nevertheless, despite the mediocre tempo as of late, I would be amiss if I didn't mention the recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,57245,00.html">announcement</a> by Microsoft to pay out dividends. A first for the software giant and maybe a prelude of things to come from other technology companies, which have traditionally refrained from paying dividends. Instead, they have usually chosen to reinvest all earning back into R&D to further fuel growth. I suspect this move by MS is to change it's investor base to align it's value with more conservative investors and affirm its long term value. I might even go so far as to say that maybe this signals a more "mature" Microsoft. However knowing Microsoft, it's probably just more marketing than financial strategy.</p>
        <p>Now if only I could find something more significant to report.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Speed Of Gravity Measured...Surprise!, Einstein Was Right</h3>
        <p>Hey, what news! Einstein was right. Scientists have measured the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993232">speed of gravity</a> using the movement of Jupiter into the lightpath of a quasar. By knowing the mass of Jupiter, corrections were taken into account for the bending of light that should occur and observing the movement of light as Jupiter passed in front of the quasar. As Jupiter's gravity bent the light as it passed, measurements were made to check the speed that the gravity influenced the light passing nearby. Final numbers came to about 95% of the speed of light with an error of 25%, so it was fairly accurate. This confirms Einstein's prediction in General Relativity that gravity propagates at the same rate as light and further fueling the speculation that gravity is akin to light in a very fundamental way. Hello, supersymmetry.</p>
        <p>I wish I knew what they were talking about when the say it disproves many newer theories the involve many dimensions. Superstring theory, in all it's various flavors, is probably included on that list. Supposedly, gravity could "shortcut" it's way through space utilizing these extra dimensions, but I assume it's just a pretty mathematics. Some kind of numerical voodoo that had nothing to do with physical observations. But such is the case without declining budgets given to physics departments nowadays. Only time will tell what effect that will have on economic development here in the US. Enough ranting, this is a great development.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Gamers have New Appreciation For MMORPGs</h3>
        <p>I've spent my share playing online with a few of the online RPGs on the market. Most recently with Anarchy Online. Which by the way has an excellent story line despite rather boring gameplay. Reading up on the history was for me more fun than actually playing the game. Especially when I first started. I had to stop playing because I no longer had DSL, or any broadband offerings in my area, besides a non-coshure 2-way satellite setup that won't work well with online games. But that's not what this post is about.</p>
        <p>Online games have an addictive quality about them. All too often, players don't have the time to build up player stats or build an arsenal of items for those character to use. A quick perusal of eBay will give way to a <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&query=diablo+2+soj&cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&ht=1&from=R10&currdisp=2&itemtimedisp=1&st=2&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&BasicSearch=">plethora of offerings</a> for sale. That's no news, but perhaps if I told you that the sales being made weren't that of the material world, but only benefit the buyer by offering their virtual character on one of the many MMORPGs available. There's a lucrative, well maybe not lucrative, market for players willing to sell characters, objects, currency, or "power-leveling" services for a fee. Stranger things are often sold on eBay, but <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2003/1/6/222558/0630">here's a guy</a> who proposes and claims to make a living off of offering these services on eBay. He says it's not for the faint of heart, nor for those that don't like sitting for hours on end. He even goes on to offer some strategies for the best possible experience for those that are interested in a gaming occupation.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Apple Making Headlines...With Me At Least</h3>
        <p>Steve Job's keynote at the MacWorldExpo has been creating <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1041978831.html">quite a stir</a>. <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0301/07.powerbooks.php">Lust inspiring laptops</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">better browsers</a> and a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/07/1920248">slew of software</a> being released for the Mac. Now I'm firmly in the PC camp, but sometimes, especially as of late, I doubt my non-Unix upbringing. Apple's marketing campaign has begun to thoroughly work it's way into my head. I have to say that I've been thoroughly tempted into at least trying a Mac. Now I know what you are saying. "It's a phase; it will pass". I know, but they're so cute. When I saw the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>, I immediately began to regret buying my Nomad Jukebox. But that's no big deal. The problem is that I keep coming across <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">Mac only applications</a>, that I really wish I could use. Top that with the fact that I'm just sick and tired of fiddling with every aspect of the PC. Using the PC is a chore, and one that I'm finding myself having a harder and harder time justifying.</p>
        <p>The grass is almost always greener on the other side. Yes, I've used that argument too. To no great effect I might add. It seem every time I turn around I'm bombarded by "bad design". I'm not only talking about the technology in PCs, but aesthetics, maybe I'm getting soft, but I'd like an app to look as well as it performs. It even seems as if the latter is getting harder to find also. No one seems to be taking the time and effort the is need to ensure their product is finished before they release it. From my experience, when something attains a cult like following it at least warrants a passing glance. I too often find myself staring instead. I've been seduced by the Mac community. Given time I'm sure that I'll buy one. Most likely when I go looking for college lifestyle functionality. That will not be any time soon unless I secure a surplus of funds.Still, that 12" <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Powerbook</a> looks sweet. Until that time I can only look on as a spectator....a dreadfully envious spectator.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Word of Hope for the Moment</h3>
        <p>I've finally gotten through with my application to MIT. All that there is to do is sit back and wait until spring. And as fate would have it, because of a less than impressive showing on the SAT's, I've began to have doubts as to why I would even try and apply. Thankfully, I'm no pretentious high school kiddie, but have had my share of disappointments whenever it came to scholastic endeavors. However, as of late, I've been feeling the heat of anxiety and the foreboding presence of impending disappointment. Call it insecurity, call it normal jitters, but whatever it is. I don't like it. I was uplifted earlier this week when I read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58951-2002Dec31.html">this article</a> at the Washingtom Post. Hey, normally I don't go for this kind of "feel good" type of writing, but I've found it really uplifting. It's about a research group that does a study of applicants that got denied admission to there "Dream" college. What they found was that even though they weren't given the brand name college treatment; they still did just as well as those that did get accepted. They call it the Spielberg Effect for reason that soon become obvious. Now, common knowledge has it that this is no new revelation, but it's still striking to see it coming from a regimented study.</p>
        <p>Also of note is <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html">another article</a> that rubbed me right. For the time being, I'll have to settle with the little bit of consolation I get from these articles until I get the verdict because no amount of intellectualizing will subdue me from biting at my nails. Wish me luck ;)</p>

        <h3 class="title">Nuclear Batteries</h3>
        <p>So far most of the nanotech articles reported on here have relied on glucose in the blood stream to power most of the devices proposed for medical uses. Well, just what happens if you need to use the same technology outside the body or in a fashion that doesn't allow a piggyback ride so to speak. Most ideas center around batteries, but that presents a problem in it's self. Common batteries we use today don't scale that well down to the size we need and still provide adequate power. Enter <a href="http://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~jake/res/batteries.htm">nuclear batteries</a>. These proposed power sources, although dubious in name, could provide a viable solution. It uses really weak radioactive isotopes. So weak in fact that after just a couple of half lives the emitted radiation is lower than that of concrete. It uses a level to collect charges as particle are emitted. As the charges build up it create an attraction that between that of the level and base creating movement that powers a servo that acts as a generator converting the attraction movement into useable electricity. When the charges build up enough, the level move into contact with the base and the charges are equalled resetting the lever and starting the cycle all over again. I'm still not sure why they don't just use the charge difference it's self as a battery, but I'm sure I've gotten my understanding of physics somehow. Anywho, it works and now they are working to scale it down to ever smaller sizes so it can be used in future MEMS.</p>

        <h3 class="title">A Level-headed Look at Microsoft</h3>
        <p>Microsoft has been through a lot during the past few years. Legal battles, questionable security initiatives (Palladium), and confusing software platforms (.Net) have all served to drag the company to new lows. Many claim the eventual demise of the juggernaut and still otherwise. What's going on at Redmond? Kuro5hin has an <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2003/1/2/153157/7696">interview with Adam Barr</a>, a former Microsoft developer who seems to have levelheaded view at to what has happened. It's hard to get truth when it comes to Microsoft simple because most of the most outspoken are either adamantly against or for the software giant.<br /></p>
        <blockquote>
          Many people consider Microsoft to be this all-powerful entity that always gets its way and succeeds in whatever it attempts (whether through technical ability, luck, marketing, or illegal means). But in fact, if you look back at all the initiatives Microsoft has attempted, most of them have failed. Remember Windows at Work, an attempt to unify all office machines on a network? Or TrueImage, a clone of the PostScript page description language? Or ACE, the Advanced Computing Environment, designed to replace the Intel PC architecture? If you look at all the things that Microsoft has boldly announced with a gaggle of industry partners, the success rate is maybe 10 to 20 percent. So pick any ten things that Microsoft is attempting now: Auto PC, cell phone operating system, set-top box, Xbox, electronic books, Internet Gaming Zone, Tablet PC, Pocket PC, speech recognition, MSN. The odds are that only one or two of those will actually succeed.<br />
        </blockquote>The last time I read anything that wasn't biased with ridicule or praise was <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/auletta/home.html"><i>World War 3.0</i> by Ken Auletta</a>. The book was written before the antitrust trails were over and explains the mentality going on at Microsoft and enlightens the viewer on some of the details of the battle. It's a good read for any who want to know more than is put out by the media and open-source community.
        <p></p>
        <p>My view: Simply put, I believe that Microsoft is a vicious competitor. Do I believe that the actions it has taken to compete are unfair? Yes, but I don't think that it came from specific management strategies, but more from a mentality to compete. From what I read Microsoft breeds a brutal competitive atmosphere and allows too much independence to it's various departments. Overly zealous employees work hard to compete with a small guy fights giant mentality and hasn't quite gotten the picture that's they're no longer the small guy. Perhaps Microsoft is just <u>too good</u> a competitor and needs to let it's enemies catch up. Microsoft needs to realize that, even though it is a very unstable market were a good idea can overtake a giant's, it still can't afford to act like it's playing catch up and act like the leader it is.</p>
        <p>Yes, I still <i>want to</i> believe in Microsoft.</p>
        <p>P.S. I have to agree with Mr. Barr, Linux is still too much tech for the average Joe. Linux on the desktop will never see widespread use until developers start working to a better experience. It can't be just as good, it has to be a better experience for users to switch.(costs aside)</p>
