        <h3 class="title">Gamers have New Appreciation For MMORPGs</h3>
        <p>I've spent my share playing online with a few of the online RPGs on the market. Most recently with Anarchy Online. Which by the way has an excellent story line despite rather boring gameplay. Reading up on the history was for me more fun than actually playing the game. Especially when I first started. I had to stop playing because I no longer had DSL, or any broadband offerings in my area, besides a non-coshure 2-way satellite setup that won't work well with online games. But that's not what this post is about.</p>
        <p>Online games have an addictive quality about them. All too often, players don't have the time to build up player stats or build an arsenal of items for those character to use. A quick perusal of eBay will give way to a <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&query=diablo+2+soj&cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&ht=1&from=R10&currdisp=2&itemtimedisp=1&st=2&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&BasicSearch=">plethora of offerings</a> for sale. That's no news, but perhaps if I told you that the sales being made weren't that of the material world, but only benefit the buyer by offering their virtual character on one of the many MMORPGs available. There's a lucrative, well maybe not lucrative, market for players willing to sell characters, objects, currency, or "power-leveling" services for a fee. Stranger things are often sold on eBay, but <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2003/1/6/222558/0630">here's a guy</a> who proposes and claims to make a living off of offering these services on eBay. He says it's not for the faint of heart, nor for those that don't like sitting for hours on end. He even goes on to offer some strategies for the best possible experience for those that are interested in a gaming occupation.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at January 8, 2003 06:24 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=131" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
