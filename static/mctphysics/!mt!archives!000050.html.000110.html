        <h3 class="title">Site navigation improved</h3>
        <p>I've been working on improving the site navigation. I was trying to make it a little more logical. Now clicking on the individual entry's header will take you to that single entries archive page with the comments that have been posted displayed on the same page. Also, the calender days now only link to that that single day's entries. And, of course the other links off to the right, correspond to their respective listing.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a>
        <p>If you noticed before, most links went to a monthly archive. And consequentely, it took a long time to load. You can still do that now if you want to, but it's not enforced on all the links, only the ones for monthly archives. And the same for Category links. Err, you get the idea. On to better news.</p>
        <p>I finally changed the banner, to reflect more accuratley what this site is about. I don't want anyone misled by the title and coming here thinking it's about military research, or other things of that nature, as Google seems to be doing when searched for by the previous title. The title was never meant to be "The Proving Grounds", it was just for development. Before that it was, "The Testing Grounds", so you can kinda see were I got that from. It was only to reflect the level of refinement that I thought the site had obtained. It was never meant to be up so long, but I had grown quite fond of it. But now it's time to move on.</p>
        <p>I still don't have a graphic. I'm not a real "artsy" type person, so please someone help me out here. I'm fresh out of idea's. So, until I find something I like, we will continue with the text only version. Which I think looks surprisingly good, in it's own right.</p>
        <p>By the way, this site is designed to be viewed at 1024X786 resolution AT LEAST! I use 1280X1024, kinda weird but it's the default resolution on my LCD. So, if your not looking at this site by those stardards, your doing yourself a grave misjustice. I saw my site at 800X600 and it looks just horrible, text all grainy and otherwise nasty looking. Frankly, I don't see how people use a computer at such low res. I'll go nuts using it and trying to work on a computer. You can't read anything at that resolution. Well you can, but it look horrendous and you'll end up scrolling for days just to read one article in most websites.</p>
        <p>For those of us less fortunate, and don't know what I'm talking about or don't know how to change their resolution. It's really easy on a Windows machine. Right click on the desktop, yeah, the one that probably has a horrible picture as a background because you haven't changed the windows default</p>
        <p>Go to "Settings", and there is a slider on the lower left. Moving it to the left makes the resolution change lower, (mental note where is now, before you change it) and moving it right makes the resolution higher.</p>
        <p>Most machines you can only change it to safe resolutions, so don't worry about messing things up. Notice the number listed below the slider, that's the resolution you currently have selected. Bump the slider up a couple of notches 'till you get at least to 1024 (FYI, The first number is the how many dots are displayed horizonally (left to right) and the second is the number vertically (Top to bottom). You can get an idea of what the screen will look like after you change it, by looking at the little picture.</p>
        <p>If you can, change the color depth to 32 with the dropdown window to the right (the one with the line of colors below it), it'll let you see more colors (than if your set to 16 or 24). If you can'just use the highest one you can. Then click apply, it may ask you if you want to test the settings first, click yes.</p>
        <p>Yeah, the screen will go blank or do some kind of test screen, you didn't mess any thing up. The new settings should now be applied, and your screen will look much different (read: better). If you see anything messed up or just got a blank screen the whole time. You set the settings to high and it'll either ask you if you want to change back or keep the new settings or it'll do it automatically.</p>
        <p>If it looks good, keep 'em, if not click no. Play around with the settings untill you find the ones you like, just remember to click "apply", not "ok", so you can test your settings first. Now enjoy your new, persective on computing. It should now be a LOT easier to read web pages. and other things of that nature.</p><span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at November 21, 2002 12:31 PM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=50" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
