        <p>Ok, so it's been a while. I haven't dropped off the face of the earth, I've just moved on to other things. I still plan to keep the site up and update it from time to time. School starts in a month or so and I'm all excited. Perhaps I'll have some more to write about then. News hounding is not my forte, as It just consumes too much of my time. Time better spent with my family and gaming of course.</p>
        <p>Maybe one day, I'll have a clear idea of what I want this website for, but for now, I'll stick to bad grammer and ill concieved rants.</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah. I just got Star Wars Galaxies for my birthday. I'll check back in with the verdict and a play guide that I'm working on when I get it finished.</p>

        <p>Well, yes, it seems the Everquest bug has hit me very hard. I'm not quite sure when I will recover, but it seems to have subsided long enough for me to read my email ans sleep, among other things. The bad news came about 2 weeks ago when I recieved a dissapontingly thin letter from MIT. So, alas, I didn't get in. I'll be attending a local university, USM, next fall. I'm not too crushed by the admissions decision because at least I'll be at home and have a much more managable tuition expense. (I wonder if I could possibly put together a more uncoherent post?)</p>
        <p>Other news has it, that I have been having problems with the site. (hence, the long over due post.) I hope that the past problems have been corrected and you can contiue read about my endless search for exciting, geeky, and altogether pointless news right here at MCTPhysics.</p>

        <p>I've recently discovered <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">Everquest.</a> I know it's been out forever, but I've never played it or even seen someone who played it. Well, needless to say, I've developed an addiction. A very welcome one at that, as now I don't have to spend countless hours on the net scouring for some bit of needless news to satisfy my boredom. I don't expect I'll stop posting here, but the frequency will probably fade maybe about 2 or 3 times a week. So ever little halfway interesting news item won't be posted now. I'll only be posting the things I really have something to say about and that which is I find very interesting. Till then, I can be found on EQ, Vazelle, as Athenu or Aeriwen, my lovely level 5 Barbarian Figher and level 16 wood Elf Druid, respectively. Yes, it's totally nerdy, but definitely fun. Evercrack indeed!</p>

        <h3 class="title"><a href="/archives/000133.html">Slow News</a></h3>
        <p>Hopefully I'm not the only one wondering why the news has been so slow lately. Nevertheless, despite the mediocre tempo as of late, I would be amiss if I didn't mention the recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,57245,00.html">announcement</a> by Microsoft to pay out dividends. A first for the software giant and maybe a prelude of things to come from other technology companies, which have traditionally refrained from paying dividends. Instead, they have usually chosen to reinvest all earning back into R&D to further fuel growth. I suspect this move by MS is to change it's investor base to align it's value with more conservative investors and affirm its long term value. I might even go so far as to say that maybe this signals a more "mature" Microsoft. However knowing Microsoft, it's probably just more marketing than financial strategy.</p>
        <p>Now if only I could find something more significant to report.</p>

        <h3 class="title"><a href="/archives/000132.html">Speed Of Gravity Measured...Surprise!, Einstein Was Right</a></h3>
        <p>Hey, what news! Einstein was right. Scientists have measured the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993232">speed of gravity</a> using the movement of Jupiter into the lightpath of a quasar. By knowing the mass of Jupiter, corrections were taken into account for the bending of light that should occur and observing the movement of light as Jupiter passed in front of the quasar. As Jupiter's gravity bent the light as it passed, measurements were made to check the speed that the gravity influenced the light passing nearby. Final numbers came to about 95% of the speed of light with an error of 25%, so it was fairly accurate. This confirms Einstein's prediction in General Relativity that gravity propagates at the same rate as light and further fueling the speculation that gravity is akin to light in a very fundamental way. Hello, supersymmetry.</p>
        <p>I wish I knew what they were talking about when the say it disproves many newer theories the involve many dimensions. Superstring theory, in all it's various flavors, is probably included on that list. Supposedly, gravity could "shortcut" it's way through space utilizing these extra dimensions, but I assume it's just a pretty mathematics. Some kind of numerical voodoo that had nothing to do with physical observations. But such is the case without declining budgets given to physics departments nowadays. Only time will tell what effect that will have on economic development here in the US. Enough ranting, this is a great development.</p>

        <p>I've spent my share playing online with a few of the online RPGs on the market. Most recently with Anarchy Online. Which by the way has an excellent story line despite rather boring gameplay. Reading up on the history was for me more fun than actually playing the game. Especially when I first started. I had to stop playing because I no longer had DSL, or any broadband offerings in my area, besides a non-coshure 2-way satellite setup that won't work well with online games. But that's not what this post is about.</p>
        <p>Online games have an addictive quality about them. All too often, players don't have the time to build up player stats or build an arsenal of items for those character to use. A quick perusal of eBay will give way to a <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&query=diablo+2+soj&cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&ht=1&from=R10&currdisp=2&itemtimedisp=1&st=2&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&BasicSearch=">plethora of offerings</a> for sale. That's no news, but perhaps if I told you that the sales being made weren't that of the material world, but only benefit the buyer by offering their virtual character on one of the many MMORPGs available. There's a lucrative, well maybe not lucrative, market for players willing to sell characters, objects, currency, or "power-leveling" services for a fee. Stranger things are often sold on eBay, but <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2003/1/6/222558/0630">here's a guy</a> who proposes and claims to make a living off of offering these services on eBay. He says it's not for the faint of heart, nor for those that don't like sitting for hours on end. He even goes on to offer some strategies for the best possible experience for those that are interested in a gaming occupation.</p>

        <p>Steve Job's keynote at the MacWorldExpo has been creating <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1041978831.html">quite a stir</a>. <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0301/07.powerbooks.php">Lust inspiring laptops</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">better browsers</a> and a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/07/1920248">slew of software</a> being released for the Mac. Now I'm firmly in the PC camp, but sometimes, especially as of late, I doubt my non-Unix upbringing. Apple's marketing campaign has begun to thoroughly work it's way into my head. I have to say that I've been thoroughly tempted into at least trying a Mac. Now I know what you are saying. "It's a phase; it will pass". I know, but they're so cute. When I saw the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>, I immediately began to regret buying my Nomad Jukebox. But that's no big deal. The problem is that I keep coming across <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">Mac only applications</a>, that I really wish I could use. Top that with the fact that I'm just sick and tired of fiddling with every aspect of the PC. Using the PC is a chore, and one that I'm finding myself having a harder and harder time justifying.</p>
        <p>The grass is almost always greener on the other side. Yes, I've used that argument too. To no great effect I might add. It seem every time I turn around I'm bombarded by "bad design". I'm not only talking about the technology in PCs, but aesthetics, maybe I'm getting soft, but I'd like an app to look as well as it performs. It even seems as if the latter is getting harder to find also. No one seems to be taking the time and effort the is need to ensure their product is finished before they release it. From my experience, when something attains a cult like following it at least warrants a passing glance. I too often find myself staring instead. I've been seduced by the Mac community. Given time I'm sure that I'll buy one. Most likely when I go looking for college lifestyle functionality. That will not be any time soon unless I secure a surplus of funds.Still, that 12" <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Powerbook</a> looks sweet. Until that time I can only look on as a spectator....a dreadfully envious spectator.</p>

        <h3 class="title"><a href="/archives/000128.html">Word of Hope for the Moment</a></h3>
        <p>I've finally gotten through with my application to MIT. All that there is to do is sit back and wait until spring. And as fate would have it, because of a less than impressive showing on the SAT's, I've began to have doubts as to why I would even try and apply. Thankfully, I'm no pretentious high school kiddie, but have had my share of disappointments whenever it came to scholastic endeavors. However, as of late, I've been feeling the heat of anxiety and the foreboding presence of impending disappointment. Call it insecurity, call it normal jitters, but whatever it is. I don't like it. I was uplifted earlier this week when I read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58951-2002Dec31.html">this article</a> at the Washingtom Post. Hey, normally I don't go for this kind of "feel good" type of writing, but I've found it really uplifting. It's about a research group that does a study of applicants that got denied admission to there "Dream" college. What they found was that even though they weren't given the brand name college treatment; they still did just as well as those that did get accepted. They call it the Spielberg Effect for reason that soon become obvious. Now, common knowledge has it that this is no new revelation, but it's still striking to see it coming from a regimented study.</p>
        <p>Also of note is <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html">another article</a> that rubbed me right. For the time being, I'll have to settle with the little bit of consolation I get from these articles until I get the verdict because no amount of intellectualizing will subdue me from biting at my nails. Wish me luck ;)</p>
