        <h3 class="title">More content to come.</h3>
        <p>I've been kicking around a few ideas for articles. I think I'll do one on the Particle/Wave duality. I have a pretty good understanding of it, so I think I know enough to write a coherent piece. It'll be targeted to the beginner. Hopefully, I can adequately explain some of the cooler aspects of physics. The stuff that got me interested. So, the requisite and oft' touted "2 slit experiment" will be presented in it's full glory (and wierdness).</p>
        <p>I fully expect this one to be much better than my Top Style review, which was horrible, at least in my opinion. (I'll be working on expanding and editing that one too.) If not then I'll just have to shoot myself or cut off my hands so I can't type anymore. I know I'm probably exagerating about how bad the article was, but, really, this one WILL be better. Scout's honor.</p>
        <p>Why do an article on physics? Well, because it what this site is about (duh). Just kidding, I'm doing it because I have some deep buring desire to evangelize everthing I do. Therefore, it's only logical I would write one on my biggest hobby. Also, I think the subject is terribly misunderstood. People should should know why this subject is SO interesting. And not just for a geek or math wiz.</p>
        <p>I think that when someone is properly exposed to some of the more intriguing aspects of modern (and classical for that matter) physics they will have no choice, but to want to know more. It's simply that addictive.</p>
        <p>(You can thank, Ray for that, Mikey! With those long talks in Hanbytown at the coffee shop.)</p>
        <p>'Till then, everyone will just have to put up with the reposted articles that I find thoughout my day. Although, some of them are quite good, I'd like to have at least a little original content. My comments are pretty good, but they do tend to get a little old after a while. Tech journal or not, I've got to find some little niche all my own, otherwise there would be no reason to come here. Especially, if you read the same sites as I do. I know what I really need. I need some "informants", yeah, thats should do the trick, "informants". I can see it now, I'll be able to say sometihng cool like "according to my sources" or have an informant named "deeptroat". Wait a minute, I think that one is already taken, but you get my drift.</p>
        <p>Maybe I'll contact Randall, 'bout getting some gaming news going on this site. I wonder how well he writes....</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at November 21, 2002 12:39 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=48" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>

        <p>Hi! It's me! Hisashiburi na? Mike sent me an e-mail and mentioned this site. Um, refresh my memory... what did we talk about when we'd go to Hamby town? I forgot. Anyway, write me if you got the time.</p><span class="comments-post">Posted by: <a href="mailto&#58;reclosadors&#64;hotmail&#46;com">Ray</a> on November 21, 2002 01:33 AM</span>
