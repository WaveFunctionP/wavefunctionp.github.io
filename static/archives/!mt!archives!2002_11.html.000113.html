        <p>I saw a link to this on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Arstechnica's</a> front page. ( permalink <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1038653446.html">here</a>) It seems that some high school kids have started tinkering with "antigravity" triangles. The triangles, powered by high voltage current, have been reported to levitate in the air. It's some realy weird stuff. Anyway here's a link to the most reputable news source listed: <a title="Wired News: 'Lifters': An Idea in the Clouds" href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,52432,00.html">Wired News: 'Lifters': An Idea in the Clouds</a></p>

        <h3 class="title">Turkey Day</h3>
        <p>Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>
        <p>The holiday guantlet has begun. I can just smell the stuffing and gravy, ham and turkey. Mmmm, I can almost feel the fat growing just thinking about it.</p>
        <p>I've spent the last few holiday seasons overseas. It's hard to believe that this is my first Thanksgiving back home with my family in 3 years. I'd almost gotten used to staring at the barrack's walls during Chrstmas and Thanksgiving. It was always fun looking forward to cookie day. Needless to say, the holidays sux in the Marines in Okinawa. Well, for me they did. Not that I didn't like Japan, but,...errr,... you know what I mean. Jeez!</p>
        <p>Anyway, I won't be online for a while. I'll be back afterwards, though, for a little more Tech goodness. But in the meantime, I'm going to pretend that the keyboard is not surgically grafted to my arms and spend some time with the family. I wonder how long I can go without touching the computer, before I break down in to tears. Hmm, rough guess....a few daaa....minutes. I know I'll do fine. I'm gonna cheat. I'm bringing my digital camera. He he.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I wish everyone a safe and enjoyable holiday.</p>

        <p>I never thought I would see the day that big media would put games in a good light. The Time website has an article up about the Sims. More specificly The Sims Online. The author says something about SimAmerica or something like that. Must everyone make an analogy out of anything and everything.

        <p>I found this on Slashdot. It seems RadioShack has finally <a href="http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2002/11/25/daily4.html">stopped</a> being so nosy. They have finally wisened up and stopped asking for your address and phone number when you check out. It always bothered me that they would ask, even when you only went there for a connector or something equally trival. I always told them; "I rather not.". But it was bothersome nonetheless.</p>

        <p>Again, moving in the political direction, but it's got some articles on technology impact. Specifically DRM.</p>
        <p>EDIT: Notice the entry there about the Indonesian government and the US and Australian involvment. Here's a <a href="http://pilger.carlton.com/print/119612">link</a> to that article. I can vouch for most everything said. I was there and believe me, the "humanitarian" operation there was a big fat JOKE. I went on the first LCU in to setup communications. It was immediately obvious, that given the resources we had, this "operation" was going to be just a training exercise. Furthermore, I began to wonder what exactly was the US trying to do. If we weren't here for aid, the why would they send us, execpt to give an appearance of simpathy. Hindsight is much clearer now, than it was then.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Unsure?</h3>
        <p>I'll settle on a title for the site one day. Notice that today's incaration is slightly less misleading. I don't want someone to come here thinking that this is a FAQ site or something along those lines. That's one of my pet peeves when it comes to the web. It's so hard to find the information you are looking for because no one is explicit in their site description. W3C has discused this at much length and has built in features to help. But, It does no good when people choose to ignore it though. I guess false advertising has it's merits. Hey, just look at PoRn sites. Preme-O example! I think they are the only ones that still use those content META tags.</p>
        <p>Yes, still no news worth mentioning. Why else do you think that I would be talking about META tags, porn and website titles. I gotta write something though. I can't let another moment pass in which I could otherwise be doing something useful. Proper time managment is over-rated you know.</p>
        <p>Enough already, the whole world is asleep, but me. Everyone over at Ars OpenForum is anyway. Excepting perhaps the hacker guys, they've always got something up their collective sleeve. No one emails me any more. Not even my own sister....HELLO! I know you're busy at work, but I'd like to here from you. Hell, I'd be happy with a blank message for that matter.</p>
        <p>//me thinks I'll stop talking now... before I say something really stupid.</p>

        <p>It's been a crazy week in tech this week. A lot happened and I hope it continues. In other news; the most searched for term to hit this site: caffeinated soap! That's right, of all the things that could bring someone here to this site; The most popular is about soap. Geek soap, but still soap nonetheless. Who'd a thunk it!</p>
        <p>It's seems as if there's nothing going on this weekend, so things have been really slow. I decided to *gasp* leave the computer and go see some family. It's good to be back, though. Because, I don't want any of my family to get used to me helping out around the house. So I needed to get back home before they could find some new project for me to do. :)</p>
        <p>That's right I'm a lazy bum. And proud of it too.</p>

        <h3 class="title">One ton Quarks</h3>
        <p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2502755.stm">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/01342.html">SMU</a> are reporting some reseachers that seem to have found evidence of Quark passing through Earth. They have singled out 2 linear seismic events that are best described by a 1 ton micron-sized "strange" quark moving throught the earth at a blistering 250 miles per second.</p>
        <p>The only evidence of this happening is twice during 1993. No other seismic data is available because the US Geological Survey stopped recording "unassociated" events. I thought this was peculiar, so I did a little checking up. I originally thought that maybe government budgets cuts had stripped the USGS of some of it's capabilities. But, the only thing I can find is that they just stopped keeping the "unassociated" events. "Unassociated" means the events were not correlated with a confirmed seismic event, such as a earthquake or volcanic eruption.</p>
        <p>After many google searches, I'm pretty sure they hust stopped recording these events because the sensitivity of the instruments taking the measurments have become too sensitive, so the were flooded with data or that the instruments have gotten more unreliable. I really can't tell from the documents which one, but I'll have to go with the former.</p>

        <h3 class="title">DNA = Fractal?</h3>
        <p>A patent has been filed by <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/11/21/jnkdna.DTL">Andras Pellionisz</a>, who expects to be able describe "junk" DNA as fractal patern.</p>
        <p>Fractals are a way to describe complex geometric structures from one formula. Sort of like the way you can descible a circle with out even having seen that particular one, simply by means of a formula. It has been speculated that DNA's pattern is seems strikingly similar to that of a fractals. Pellionisz's hopes process would allow for a way to understand the "junk DNA's" purpose. As, Intron, the "junk DNA", is much more abundant than the more useful portions called "genes".</p>
        <p>It's interesting to see biology being put a more rigorous mathematical footing. If this trend continues it could be very beneficial to biology's growth. Just look what math did for physics. Without a standard and univerally understood language, physics would be nowhere near where it is today. It's amasing to think how flexible numbers are at describing the world. It's mind-blowing that something so simple can even begin to describe what we see around us everyday.</p>
        <p>But, then again, I've been told that I think too much.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Classic Gaming</h3>
        <p>I was browsing the web, and came up on a site that had an intro theme like that of an old Atari game. It reminded me of how much I miss those simple games, as most games today are quite complicated. Sometimes you just need to get back to the <a title="ClassicGaming - A Member of The GameSpy Network" href="http://www.classicgaming.com/">basics</a> to really appreciate things. So, now I can't wait 'till I get the Atari 2600 emulator downloaded so I can play Frogger and Journey, among many other great classics.</p>
        <p>Update: I found a few sites for you Atari 2600 freaks out there. These were the best I've found.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.emulator-zone.com/">The Emulator Zone</a><br />
        <a href="http://www.atariage.com/index.html">AtariAge</a></p>
        <p>This is by no means a complete list, obviously. But I'm rather picky, so I only go to some the more reputable sites. But, you can do what you like. I just found no need to go to any other sites after I found these. Google will turn up plenty of results.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for an emulator and are using a modern operating system, the best one (by far) for the 2600 is <a href="http://www.emuunlim.com/stellax/">StellaX</a>. The others had a lot of problems with the sound. I tried to download it from their site, but it seems that SourceForge is experiencing technical difficulties, but luckily a quick glance at the latest version number and a google query turned up <a href="http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/a2600/stella.html">this</a>. Which is how I found The Emulator Zone.</p>
        <p>You can download ROMs at AtariAge, they have some of them available prebundled in a zip file, so you don't have to download each one that you want individually, since they are only 4K in size. Most of the classics are included in the files, along with more obscure titles. And if the prepackaged zips don't have the game you want. Don't frett, they should have it available on it's own. Along with packaging scans and cartridge photos no less! (These guys do it right!) The list of missing titles from their archives is only like 8 entries long. That's pretty impressive considering how many titles were published for that system. See now, I've taken most all the legwork out of it. Happy gaming ; )</p>

        <h3 class="title">Genetic Research Rant</h3>
        <p>I've been waiting for news of <a title="Scientists Planning to Make New Form of Life (washingtonpost.com)" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17496-2002Nov20.html">this</a> to comeout for some time now. Genomic research is so misunderstood and undiservingly feared.</p>
        <p>The potential benefits simply outweigh the oportunity for abuse. Detractors often cite these type of projects as being similar to the atomic bomb. I don't see any one complaining about how low our oil prices are compared to other countries, or how low our electricity bills are. Nuclear reactors are a necessity now in our energy dependent society. And without prior research in to harnassing nuclear energy that was developed during the Manhattan Preject, we arguably wouldn't have these power plants.</p>
        <p>The Bomb is a terrible use of technology, but I still don't see Iraq just up and dropping one on Saudi Arabia. Nor, do I see it happening anytime soon. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. never got into open conflict simply because of it's tremendous power. Looks like a war deterrent to me. We have some crazy people in this world, but not many are that crazy. To get enough people together for a project of that kind of magnatude would require, MANY insane individuals. Hello, top that off with the fact that most mental instablities have an added side effect of some form isolation. So, now, how do you get a bunch of nutballs together. Go to a mental ward and you will see what I mean.</p>
        <p>Also, many advocates say that such meddling in sacreligious and should be banned. I agree it is obviously in direct conflict with most religious views and consideration has been carefully taken to avoid claims of heresy, but science is a secular endevor. And, as such, is not confined by the conservative views of theology. The arguement that humans should not play God, is absolutley absurd in my opinion, because if we weren't supposed to; why then were we given this knowledge in the first place? And just why would we have a will to carry out such disputablely, reckless undertakings?</p>
        <p>Conversely, Why not? To deny ourselves of our intelectual persuits, is to deny ourselves of the very thing which protects us from extiction.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Site navigation improved</h3>
        <p>I've been working on improving the site navigation. I was trying to make it a little more logical. Now clicking on the individual entry's header will take you to that single entries archive page with the comments that have been posted displayed on the same page. Also, the calender days now only link to that that single day's entries. And, of course the other links off to the right, correspond to their respective listing.</p>
        <p>If you noticed before, most links went to a monthly archive. And consequentely, it took a long time to load. You can still do that now if you want to, but it's not enforced on all the links, only the ones for monthly archives. And the same for Category links. Err, you get the idea. On to better news.</p>
        <p>I finally changed the banner, to reflect more accuratley what this site is about. I don't want anyone misled by the title and coming here thinking it's about military research, or other things of that nature, as Google seems to be doing when searched for by the previous title. The title was never meant to be "The Proving Grounds", it was just for development. Before that it was, "The Testing Grounds", so you can kinda see were I got that from. It was only to reflect the level of refinement that I thought the site had obtained. It was never meant to be up so long, but I had grown quite fond of it. But now it's time to move on.</p>
        <p>I still don't have a graphic. I'm not a real "artsy" type person, so please someone help me out here. I'm fresh out of idea's. So, until I find something I like, we will continue with the text only version. Which I think looks surprisingly good, in it's own right.</p>
        <p>By the way, this site is designed to be viewed at 1024X786 resolution AT LEAST! I use 1280X1024, kinda weird but it's the default resolution on my LCD. So, if your not looking at this site by those stardards, your doing yourself a grave misjustice. I saw my site at 800X600 and it looks just horrible, text all grainy and otherwise nasty looking. Frankly, I don't see how people use a computer at such low res. I'll go nuts using it and trying to work on a computer. You can't read anything at that resolution. Well you can, but it look horrendous and you'll end up scrolling for days just to read one article in most websites.</p>
        <p>For those of us less fortunate, and don't know what I'm talking about or don't know how to change their resolution. It's really easy on a Windows machine. Right click on the desktop, yeah, the one that probably has a horrible picture as a background because you haven't changed the windows default</p>
        <p>Go to "Settings", and there is a slider on the lower left. Moving it to the left makes the resolution change lower, (mental note where is now, before you change it) and moving it right makes the resolution higher.</p>
        <p>Most machines you can only change it to safe resolutions, so don't worry about messing things up. Notice the number listed below the slider, that's the resolution you currently have selected. Bump the slider up a couple of notches 'till you get at least to 1024 (FYI, The first number is the how many dots are displayed horizonally (left to right) and the second is the number vertically (Top to bottom). You can get an idea of what the screen will look like after you change it, by looking at the little picture.</p>
        <p>If you can, change the color depth to 32 with the dropdown window to the right (the one with the line of colors below it), it'll let you see more colors (than if your set to 16 or 24). If you can'just use the highest one you can. Then click apply, it may ask you if you want to test the settings first, click yes.</p>
        <p>Yeah, the screen will go blank or do some kind of test screen, you didn't mess any thing up. The new settings should now be applied, and your screen will look much different (read: better). If you see anything messed up or just got a blank screen the whole time. You set the settings to high and it'll either ask you if you want to change back or keep the new settings or it'll do it automatically.</p>
        <p>If it looks good, keep 'em, if not click no. Play around with the settings untill you find the ones you like, just remember to click "apply", not "ok", so you can test your settings first. Now enjoy your new, persective on computing. It should now be a LOT easier to read web pages. and other things of that nature.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Comments?</h3>
        <p>I was wondering about how to improve the site. I would really like to see some more participation. However, I don't know If people see the "comments" button below each post or if 'netizens are just inherently consumers. Any way, the comments below each news post are free and easy to use. I only require an email address. Don't worry, I hate it when companies sell my email address to spammers, so I won't do the same. Beside, as you can see, this site is supported out of my own funds rather than advertising. Note the lack of ads and banners. I plan to keep it that way, if at all possible.</p>
        <p>I just think that if people participate, the site will be much more lively. I would like to have a little community if at all possible. If you don't like the way the comments are being implemented and would like to see something else. Just tell me. I've been toying with the idea of linking a discussion forum to each post, instead of the comments. But, I'm not going to do it if no one is going to use it. It cost me money to buy another MySQL DB to host on this site, not to mention the hassle of seting it up with my posting engine. But I'll do it if I think it will be used.</p>
        <p>Just tell me what you think.</p>
        <p>Personally, I think the current setup is fine, but the forum will be more stuctured and flexible at the same time. But it will be harder to use, for most people I know. Just let me know. Yes!!, that means you!</p>

        <h3 class="title">More content to come.</h3>
        <p>I've been kicking around a few ideas for articles. I think I'll do one on the Particle/Wave duality. I have a pretty good understanding of it, so I think I know enough to write a coherent piece. It'll be targeted to the beginner. Hopefully, I can adequately explain some of the cooler aspects of physics. The stuff that got me interested. So, the requisite and oft' touted "2 slit experiment" will be presented in it's full glory (and wierdness).</p>
        <p>I fully expect this one to be much better than my Top Style review, which was horrible, at least in my opinion. (I'll be working on expanding and editing that one too.) If not then I'll just have to shoot myself or cut off my hands so I can't type anymore. I know I'm probably exagerating about how bad the article was, but, really, this one WILL be better. Scout's honor.</p>
        <p>Why do an article on physics? Well, because it what this site is about (duh). Just kidding, I'm doing it because I have some deep buring desire to evangelize everthing I do. Therefore, it's only logical I would write one on my biggest hobby. Also, I think the subject is terribly misunderstood. People should should know why this subject is SO interesting. And not just for a geek or math wiz.</p>
        <p>I think that when someone is properly exposed to some of the more intriguing aspects of modern (and classical for that matter) physics they will have no choice, but to want to know more. It's simply that addictive.</p>
        <p>(You can thank, Ray for that, Mikey! With those long talks in Hanbytown at the coffee shop.)</p>
        <p>'Till then, everyone will just have to put up with the reposted articles that I find thoughout my day. Although, some of them are quite good, I'd like to have at least a little original content. My comments are pretty good, but they do tend to get a little old after a while. Tech journal or not, I've got to find some little niche all my own, otherwise there would be no reason to come here. Especially, if you read the same sites as I do. I know what I really need. I need some "informants", yeah, thats should do the trick, "informants". I can see it now, I'll be able to say sometihng cool like "according to my sources" or have an informant named "deeptroat". Wait a minute, I think that one is already taken, but you get my drift.</p>
        <p>Maybe I'll contact Randall, 'bout getting some gaming news going on this site. I wonder how well he writes....</p>

        It's nice to see someone actually using the feeds. Though, at first, I was a little perplexed as to why I was getting the newswire links in my server logs. How are they working?

The competition host asked: "If you could live forever, would you want to, and why?" Miss Alabama answered, "I would not live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever."

        <p>Those of you who know me well, know that I am a huge fan of <a title="Ayumi Hamasaki" href="http://home.no.net/ayumi/">Ayumi Hamasaki</a>. If you've never heard of her then you should, she only the most remixed artist of all time. I learned of the Japanese Diva during my stay in Japan and soon fell in love.<br />
        OK, I'll stop oogling, but not until I tell you about her new trance mix album. (You can get it at <a href="http://us.yesasia.com/">YesAsia</a>.) Following in the sucess of the previous "CYBERTrance presents". AyuTrance 2 is a nonstop megamix, similar in style to those MEGA MIX albums so popular in Japan. I swear this stuff is like crack. And once you go JPop you never go back. Now all I got to do is survive through the torment and suspence as I wait for my copy. : (</p>

        <p>More news along the same lines as my previous post. This one's about Stephen Wolfram<br />

          <p>What happened to Stephen Wolfram in the interim has become sort of an urban legend in the scientific community. Not long after our dinner, which occurred in the spring of 1992, he became, in his own words, a "recluse." He moved, with the woman he had recently married (a mathematician), to the Chicago area and started a family. He rarely made the two-hour drive to Wolfram Research, his thriving software company. Instead, he put himself in a kind of voluntary house arrest, single-mindedly devoted to the completion of the book. "He dropped totally out of the scene in every sense of the word," says his friend Terrence Sejnowski, a neuroscientist at the Salk Institute. "He hasn't published a word, he doesn't go to meetings. He's in a self-made isolation center." To maximize his concentration, Wolfram became nocturnal: He worked at night, when the world was asleep, and retired at 8 in the morning.</p>

          I asked Tipler which side of the Fredkin gap he is on. Does he go along with the weak version of the ultimate computer, the metaphorical one, that says the universe only seems like a computer? Or does he embrace Fredkin's strong version, that the universe is a 12 billion-year-old computer and we are the killer app? "I regard the two statements as equivalent," he answered. "If the universe in all ways acts as if it was a computer, then what meaning could there be in saying that it is not a computer?"

        Many of you know that I hold some of the same views mentioned here. I've been struggling to piece it all together, but I've thus far reach nowhere near this level of clarity. Now I know where to loook and I can see I've go a lot of reading ahead. Don't forget to read the article all the way through (follow the links to the other pages of the article). Before you shun the ideas presented as ubsurd. remember that the people the reporter is writing about are prominent scientist. And as such, many of them are responible for a large part of our understanding of the physical world. Keep an open mind.<br />
        <br />
        Now perhap you can understand why I want to be physists. What other jobs let you contemplate the nature of reality, among other things, and get (Real) paid! #cue: Beck music# Now where else do get such drama? I love this stuff.

        <h3 class="title">And now, the human race will be even dumber.</h3>
        <p>The DoE has anounced the contruction of a pair of new supercomputers that will be (theoretically) as <a title="Wired News: This Is Your Computer on Brains" href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,56459,00.html">powerfull as the human brain</a>! That is, in terms of number of calculations. IBM expects it to be completed in 2003, for a measley $290 billion. It's kind of hard to believe that my future children will enter into a world where computers are undisputably more powerful than humans, AI concerns aside. We still have a long way to go untill we see any sort of inteligence come from this hardware. If it's even possible. I gues I need to do around and finally finish reading, "The Imperor's New Mind" by Roger Penrose before making too many speculations. But hey, it wouldn't be ant fun to not make any guesses about this kind of stuff.</p>
        <p>Again, <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/">"The Singularity"</a> approches. Or, err, something like that. ; )</p>

        <p>Don't forget about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2481681.stm">Leonid meteor shower</a> tonight, err, this morning. 0530 PST. It's supposed to be better than the one last year. I saw that one in Japan and it was spectacular. Looks like it's going to be a cold morning again this time. If it goes anything like last year it should last for a couple of hours, so get your booties out of bed. If your reading this the morning after, and beating up on yourselr. Don't. They'll be another next year, but don't count on it being as good as this or last year's. If you saw last year's, you know just how surprising it was. It was much more active than was expected.</p>
        <p>I think this years will be the same, simply because last year, by most accounts, Japan was the best vantage point. And this year North America will have the same approximate vantage and timing. Especially the timing. Looks like I'll have two good years in a row. he he, ain't I lucky!</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/19/national/19COUR.html">Court "Overturns Limits on Wiretaps to Combat Terror"</a>, one of the many headlines so familiar since 9/11, rings a familiar tone in the ears of many. Bygone periods in U.S. history where civil rights, so adamantly fought for by our "forefathers" (at least that's the route popular history likes to take), were so abruptly cast away in a fury and paranoia of public sentiment. Perhaps <a href="http://www.progressive.org/0901/roth0102.html">McCarthyism</a>, didn't teach America the lesson it sould have, and we are destined for a refresher course. Undoubtedly, we will take it willingly; trusting our gut feelings about what makes this country so great. Patriotism (read: Propaganda) is the fuel to the fire. It was also Nazi Germany's fuel of choice, as well as our's during WWII. Complete with our own version of prison camp. National security being of supreme importance, even above that of the very people our country is suposed to protect.</p>
        <p>I thinks it's going to take some time for all this stuff to sink in. Still, I think i'm going to be very nautious before everything is said and done. I love this country as much as the next guy, but enough is enough. I feel as if I've steped into some sort of "Twilight Zone". Needless to say, I don't like it and I'm waiting for the credits.</p>

        <p>I swear. I'm only off the net for a week and it seems like forever. I'm having server problems right now, my host is doing something to the hardware right now. There's no telling, but it's been makeing my scripts respond like ass. Putting it nicely, that is.</p>
        <p>You religious zealots out there might have fun with <a href="http://www.selectsmart.com/RELIGION/">this</a>. It said I was a "Ultimate Unitarian or Nontheist, whatever that is. Please try not to take it too seriously.</p>
        <p>/. has a link up to a <a href="http://www.nik.com.au/alice/">conversation</a> between two ALICE bots. I almost fell out of my seat laughing at it. So don't say I didn't warn you. I also tried my hand at talking to ALICE, and personally I don't see what the big deal is about it. You know those intelectual types have to give "awards" to someone...right? Why not a guy who makes a bot capable of small talk? Seems their time would be better spent, coming up with their own unique ideas instead of critiquing other's. That's right, I don't think people need reconition and praise to be motivated.</p>
        <p>I went and saw Tool last weekend down on the coast. Disappointed is a major understatement. Seeing the Lead singer's ass the whole time, because he wouldn't turn around and stop facing the background screen, was far from entertaining. Especially after surviving "Mushugga", the opening act, and the obnoxiously loud music that insued therefter. I would normally take the fact that I thought the music was too loud as a sign that I'm getting to old, that is until I turn around a see the 17/18 year old teenyboppers with their hands over their ears. Also there's the fact that for about half an hour, we thought the band had walked out on us. No "were going to take a short break" or "we'll be back in a few" for us. Nope, he just walked off the stage in the middle of the show without even noticing the band of his departure. Prefering the let them figure it out themselves. And leaving the crowd without a clue. Wondering why did they pay $40 for a ticket to see this circus act. I love Tool, but ...Damn!</p>
        <p>I gots a hunch that Tool didn't want to be in Mississippi. Just a little.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Crisis in Physics?</h3>Physics Today has a well written piece addressing a growing concern in the scientific community. First there were the budget cut and stagnating development funds, but that's not the major issue. I the problem seems to stem from a lack of enthusiasm. Although not without acomplishments, physicists seem to be rather unoptimistic about the discoveries made during the last few years. Instead, generally, they are reluctant to reconize their progress. Discoveries made today are sometimes seen as exceedingly trite in light of past eras. The "Standard Model" has revealed such depth and complexity that even the most exceptional have found it overwhelming. Physicist have difficulty even keeping up with their field, nevermind what is going in another colleague's. Communication between the various fields has become a rare occurance and overall, unity has suffered.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="quote">
          <a title="Physics Today November 2002" href="http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-55/iss-11/p56.html">Physics Today November 2002</a><br />
          <br />
          Is it fair to assert that physics is in crisis? Certainly physicists in the US do face a crisis of funding; many years of flat research budgets and even flat-flat (that is, constant-dollar) budgets, have slowed and discouraged the new initiatives that constitute the future of US physics. Another decade of stagnant or declining funding would eliminate any pretense of the US as a world leader in physics research. That loss would be a terrible outcome both for physics and for the long-term prosperity and security of the US.
        </div><br />
        <br />
        Funny thing is you don't even need to be involve in actual physics (like me) to see this. Even an idiot like me can see that a large number of physicists don't regard other fields outside their own, as important as their own field. Perhaps going so far as possessing an elitist's attitude. Well, there's my two cents.

        <p>Is anyone having problems displaying the page? I originally composed this site for IE 6 and it displays pages slightly different in terms of width calulation than the CSS spec. I'm looking at the page in Mozilla and the layout is all messed up. My sidebar, that's supposed to be on the right, shows up in floating somewhere in my content section. I'm not sure if it's a bug in Mozilla. but Amaya also doesn't display it properly either. I guess I'm be reading lots of stuff on CSS 2 and browser's rendering limitaions tonight. Well, if you notice anything, please contact <a href="mailto:derfuehrer@mctphysics.com">me</a> or feel free to comment.</p>
        <p>Also, I'm working on a logo graphic for the banner. Something to do with technology or physics. I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking for. But I'll know it when I see it. How 'bout some ideas, guys?</p>

        <p>Kevin Mitnick, the first hacker ever to be convicted of computer crime, has written a book on Hacking. The first Chapter of "The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security" was originaly omitted by the publisher for undisclosed reasons. Now the chapter has appeared on the web, as is chronicled in this <a title="Wired News: Mitnick's 'Lost Chapter' Found" href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,56187,00.html">Wired</a> artiicle. The full chapter has been posted up all over the net, but checking out his girlfriend's <a title="Mitnick's First Chapter :: Labmistress.com :: News & Product Reviews" href="http://www.labmistress.com/content/pn/html/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0">blog</a> will get you the most credible copy. Take a peak into the most influencial (infamous) hacker ever to hit the news. Maybe this'll quell some of your fears as to what (one atleast) hackers are like. And just what happened before he was arrested.</p>

        <p>It so sad that NASA, with all it prestige and respect, even takes the time to do this. Especially given their ,although large, tight budget. It seems that NASA is tired of all the claims by conspiracy theorists, zealots and crackpots, have been putting forth since even before the Apollo 11 astronauts set foot back on earth. NASA has <a title="Yahoo! News - No Apollo Moon Landing? NASA Book to Combat Doubts" href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=585&e=1&cid=585&u=/nm/20021105/sc_nm/space_moon_dc">commisioned</a> someone to compose a book with the sole purpose of convincing the "unbelievers" that NASA did in fact got to the moon, multiple times.

The U.S. Army has developed a tracking-targeting-firing system that can now knock a shell, moving faster than the speed of sound, right out of the air. Called Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL), it successfully destroyed a supersonic mortor round during test in White Sands, New Mexico.

        <h3 class="title">Top Sytle Pro 3 Review</h3>Well, I promised it to you and, finally, after long debate and many revisions, I present my <a title="TopStyle Pro HTML Editor, CSS Editor, XHTML Editor for Windows" href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">TopStyle Pro HTML Editor, CSS Editor, XHTML Editor for Windows</a> review. For those wondering, Top style provides a intuitive interface and handy tools to validate and clean up what would otherwise be very tedious and time consuming work.<br />
        <br />
        This is just the first of the original content that I plan to provide on this stie. My plans include much more. To include: detailed reviews, witty essays, and powerful editorials. Along with my daily web commentary, and insiteful news post. Provided I have the time of course. This is just a hobby for me after all.<br />
        I found <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">Top Style Pro 3</a> from a need to edit my CSS files, but what I found was so much more. I can't say adaquately how much I love this program. Enthusiasm aside, let's dig in.<br />
        No really, what is TS. Feature list is as follows, ripped right from the web site:<br />
        <br />
        <div class="quote">
          HTML and XHTML editing - TopStyle comes into its own as a powerful HTML and XHTML editor!<br />

          <br />
        </div>Heewwww! man, thats a mouth full. So whats that saying. It's saying, that if you prefer to edit you html and css manually and generally use WYSIWYG editors for basic layout only; this it the product for you. It even support most scripts.<br />
        <br />
        Where TS shines most is CSS editing. You use a separtate "selector box" to choose your selectors, ID's and elements. You can use a simple integrated interface or, if you like, you can organize you tools by use of a dock system. Those of you that are familiar with Photoshop or Dreamweaver, will feel right at home. And, yes, you can easily switch and save dock layouts by a simple layout selector.<br />
        <br />
        TS is not for the faint of heart, it has a pretty intense learning curve. It's nowhere near that of Photoshop, Dreamweaver and the like though. I found that it took me about full 6 hours of work to where I was comforable and had everything how I wanted.<br />
        <br />
        Also of note is the preview panels. They are up dated after every change, so no switching back and forth between modes to see what the finished product will look like. Also, I mentioned earlier that TS will check you code for errors. Well, first thing you'll want to do is; decide what all will you want it to check for. It'll show compatibility alerts and error for a seemingly endless list of browsers and standards, from Netscape 3.0 to CSS 2.0, not to mention even provide solutions for and reasons behind the errors and warnings. And simplely clicking on the error/warning will automatically select the apropriate tag or ID.<br />
        <br />
        Color management is a snap. With a simple palette selector that link to the same color elements. For instance, if to choose to change the color of my text that have been formatted to "black", simplely select "black" and goto the color chooser and change to another color. Say "Red", now all the elements on my page that are the "black" will be change to "red". Simple as that! No more repetitious cutting and pasting, and no more need for macros or "find and replace". Smooth as butta!<br />
        <br />
        With all that said, I have 2 gripes. First is this package would be absolutely wonderful if it had an FTP client intergrated. That is a sore point to an otherwise top notch program. (They allow a plugin to an external ftp client, but that's no substitute in my opinion.) Second is price, 50 bucks is still a little steep for such a specialized program, no matter how good. I'm so cheap, I'm still using the <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/download/index.asp">demo</a> and dread the day when the demo runs out, as I'm morally (and legally as well) obligated to buy it when it expires.<br />
        <br />
        TS is excellent, and I whole-heartedly recommend this product to anyone who doesn't mind editing text, prefer to do so, and want completely clean code for there web pages.

        <h3 class="title">Digital Freedom under fire?</h3>
        <p>Considering all the discussion about civil rights after 9/11, you would think that any civil rights resticting bills proposed by congress would be scrutinized more than usual, especially when "national security" is not a factor.<br />
        I found an intresting website listing some "badboy" bills that have been passed or are up for consideration.<a title="American Open Technology Consortium: The Worst Coders in Washington" href="http://www.aotc.info/archives/000152.html#000152">American Open Technology Consortium: The Worst Coders in Washington</a> even has a list of legislators that have shown support for some of these bills. They even included campain contribution amounts from technology evil types ("Hollywood").<br />
        It's sad to see that one of my representatives on the list (Chip Pickering) at the top of the list no less. Most interesting, considering Ms lost a seat in Congress after the last census and "Chippy" is, or was, in a rather heated battle for the election this season. My old stand by man, Trent Lott, is not on the list though thank good!<br />
        Personally, the ones that concern me the most are DMCA, CIPA, and the"Berman P2P bill" (that gut most be on crack, thinking to legalizing vigilanteism on the net). DMCA will hopefully be neutered some next session with a couple of proposed bills to provide copyright liscensee protection. Ironic considering we had those rights before DMCA. CIPA is just wrong, any kind of censoring in the schools and libraries, direct or otherwise, makes a dangerous precident on what the government can force the public to see. (or not see) Before long, history books will be reading like there was no civil right movement or that Clinton was never involved with anything to do with cigars.<br />
        Another rant, I know, but I just can't keep this stuff in. It's just not healthy.<br /></p>

        <p>I've finally reach a reasonably final state with the design of the site. I've tweaked the code to output valid XHTML, XML, and CSS documents. Check it out on the validation links to the right. The ones with the red checkmarks. They send you to the World Wide Web Consorium (W3C) validation service pages and automatically validate my site. Try it out. See, no errors at all! Not so much as a warning. Ain't I just super.</p>
        <p>Feel free to comment below on the changes I've made to the site. I love hearing from you.</p>
        <p>I've included a XML logo to my RSS feed, for those synication junkies. (You know who you are.)</p>

        <h3 class="title">Spam filtering - Napster style!</h3>
        <p>If you're like me, your probably getting more spam than legit email. I get about 400 spam messages a day through my Yahoo! account alone.</p>
        <p>Well, thanks to a simple Outlook plugin, SpamNet, you can enjoy a nearly spamfree inbox. I just installed it today and it has already stopped nearly 300 spam messages from reaching my inbox.</p>
        <p>It simply checks your mail as it's being downloaded and checks a network of human edited lists of known spam. If the network says it's spam, it sends it to a separate folder that can be checked periodicly to insure that legitimate emails are not "listed". It's really easy to use, and runs in the back ground. If you still get spam in your inbox, simply click the spam button and it's moves the message to your spam folder and notifies SpamNet of the new spam message, so it will get filtered for other users. Likewise, you can do the reverse if you find a legitimate email in the spam folder.</p>
        <p>I'm getting about 90% accuracy, and none of my legit emails have been filtered. It's great! It's only for Outlook users though, but hopefully they will provide support for other clients soon. Get it <a title="cloudmark: home" href="http://www.cloudmark.com/">here</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Physics for your ol' man</h3>
        <p>I went to Jackson the other day with my Dad to pick up some parts for my computer. We were talking and somehow we got on the subject of why I want to study physics. Of particular intrest to him was why I would read about a subject most people dread taking in college. Nevermind studying it for fun!<br />
        (I know I'm a geek. It's cool.)</p>
        <p>I soon realized just how hard it is to explain physics. I tried explaining some of the features of superstring theory and a few particle interations. Before it was over, I probably covered each subject like 3 times. But even after he had a suitable understanding of what I was saying, he still couldn't understand what was so exciting. Nevermind what was so desirable about symmetry!</p>
        <p>I think it's akin to trying to get someone excited about baseball when they are not familiar with the game, nor any sport for that matter.</p>
        <p>Maybe I should have used the "two slits" experiment or explained boiling "watched" celcium atoms and all the wierdness that insues. Perhaps that would have pique his interest. Nevertheless, I've given up on trying to talk about it with my family. I guess I'll have to wait till I get into school to have an informed discusion.</p>
        <p>Some light reading for those still interested:<a title="The Official String Theory Web Site" href="http://superstringtheory.com/index.html">The Official String Theory Web Site</a> Great for beginners and (oxymoron alert!) advanced beginners like me.</p>

        <h3 class="title">IM bliss soon to come...maybe</h3>The state of instant messaging (IM) on the internet looks to get a lot better soon.<a title="WG Review: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (xmpp)" href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/ietf-announce/Current/msg20416.html">WG Review: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (xmpp)</a> is a working group proposed to formulate a standard IM interface.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-964317.html">Headlines</a> as follows:<br />
        <br />
        <div class="quote">
          The Internet's governing technical body quietly gave its stamp of approval Thursday to a group intent on creating an open standard for instant messaging. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the group that sets the technical standards for the Internet, gave the go-ahead to the creators of open-source instant-messaging application Jabber to create a working group based on that technology. These such groups plan the specific implementations of the technologies that make up the Internet.
        </div><br />
        <br />
        Anyone who has used IM before knows just how frustrating it is to use. Current implementations all use proprietary protocols to comunicate. Talking to your friends on different networks at the same time requires you to have multiple clients open at the same time. I use <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a> to combine the big four(Y!, AIM, ICQ, MSN) different clients in to one application. But that's just a "work around" to a bigger problem.<br />
        <br />
        AOL has planned to add interoperablilty between ICQ and AIM on their next release. (AOL owns both so that makes sense anyway.) Also, IBM and Microsoft have been working on their own using SIMPLE.<br />
        <br />
        Good things seem to be in the air. I just hope common sense provails and these people start working with each other.

        <p>Well, I got a new MB. Asus A7V333. This board is sweet. Instalation was nearly flawless. I'm not sure if that is a indication of good skills or a good board, but my Tyan installation didn't go nearly as well. I still dread sending the thing off to be repaired though. Not just because I got to pay for it to be shipped. But because the sooner I get my Tyan back, the sooner I have to give up the Asus. (It's supposed to be used in another computer I'm building for my parents.)</p>
        <p>I took the SAT I today also. It was easier than I though it was going to be. I think I did well (not perfect though). I ran out of time on one of the math sections. The part that you have to fill in by hand. Oh well, time to prepare for the SAT II now. No time to be bummed out from missing a few questions.</p>
