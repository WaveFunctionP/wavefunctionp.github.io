        <h3 class="title">Cloned Baby Born</h3>
        <p>I find it interesting that one the first things that is mentioned about the supposed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/science/27CLON.html">cloned baby</a> is that a "religious sect" is the one responible. Could they possibly be more rude. When a Baptist or Muslim is mentioned in the news they aren't referred to as a "sect". They are given their due respect and referred by their affiliation. Not slandered by refusing to call them by their chosen name.</p>
        <p>Then there's the fact that people seem to find it more interesting to note that religion's beliefs as if to imply that it is ludicrus to believe as they do. Now I don't subscribe to this religions beliefs, but it seems to me that many people hold a equally unplausable beliefs:</p>
        <p>The belief some people hold that human life shouldn't be cloned. Same for anyone that argues that stem cell research shouldn't be allowed because it's unethical. Who are they to say when life is sacred and when it's not. When a cell is a cell or when it's something more. Just because something developes into a human, doesn't mean that before it gets to that point it should be subject to human rights. Or should it? I'm a reductionist so I have a hard time seeing the difference between a advanced chemical reaction and life at that level.</p>
        <p>For that matter, if we want to take that reasoning (that a human embryo in more than just another cell) to it's logical conclusion it's seems to me that then we would be surrounded by bigots. After all, surgery and many medical treatments (tumors) all involve killing cells, in a fully developed human being no less. How is that different. Why can you do one, but not the other. I don't see how someone can firmy hold to their beliefs just because they "believe" the to be true. Even when presented with an obvious contradiction.</p>
        <p>Just because an embryo *might* develope into a person, somehow that justifies banning useful research. Why is it that genetic research is fine if it's for exclusively for medical purposes, but not alright for me to say what color hair my child should have. We are on the brink surpassing biological evolution, but the one thing that allows us it contemplate it, is the same thing that keeps us from using for reasons of morality? Come on people, our intelligence got us here and dropped the blueprints to our very existence right on our lap. Why we can't use it? It's absurd.</p>
        <p>The day the human race realizes that we are a enormously complicated system of molecules that has developed a superiority complex; the sooner when can move on to a more productive existence. The sooner that we find a more acceptable understanding of complexity and chaos, the sooner we begin to understand our true condition. One might say that life wasn't unique or what would be the value of human life if you believe that we're nothing more than a pile of atoms. The value comes from the complexity, it's what makes each and everyone of us unique. Like many complex system the finished product is more than what is put in. So in that sense each person would still be valuable; not just a lump of talking carbon. But it is kind of funny to look at it that way. Go on try it next time you see someone, you'll see what I mean by the result is more than the sum. A most powerful and undeniably hillarious example. Humanistic ethics are still intact, just slightly....altered.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Ian Wilmut at it again</h3>
        <p>The cloning grand master is at it <a title="Independent News" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_medical/story.jsp?story=355574">again</a>. This time he wants to create stems cells off of human egg cells. He's seeking a government license before he can start research. He wants to use a proceedure called parthenogenesis to stimulate egg cells in to unfertilized embryo's. Stem cells are very intresting because they lack any of the function specific "optimizations" that fully developed cells have. (heart muscle, bone marrow, brain matter and such) It is hoped that(if they find a way to reverse the process) stem cells could provide tissue that would not be subject to rejection from the new transplant host. Among many other posible uses for stem cells.</p>
        <p>On another note, I'd love to have a clone of my self. I could teach myself all the things that I should have learned the first time around. I'd be the quinesntial oracle as to what is going to happen to his body as it developes. Such as when I was growing up I had a hard time dealing with how skinny I was and dealing with my extremely long legs. I'd already have it figured out how he should deal with that situation. No more wasted time trying to figure out his strength and weeknesses. Just plenty of time to improve even further on those strengths.</p>
        <p>Well, I think it would be cool; freaky, yes, but still cool all the same.</p>

        <h3 class="title">DNA = Fractal?</h3>
        <p>A patent has been filed by <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/11/21/jnkdna.DTL">Andras Pellionisz</a>, who expects to be able describe "junk" DNA as fractal patern.</p>
        <p>Fractals are a way to describe complex geometric structures from one formula. Sort of like the way you can descible a circle with out even having seen that particular one, simply by means of a formula. It has been speculated that DNA's pattern is seems strikingly similar to that of a fractals. Pellionisz's hopes process would allow for a way to understand the "junk DNA's" purpose. As, Intron, the "junk DNA", is much more abundant than the more useful portions called "genes".</p>
        <p>It's interesting to see biology being put a more rigorous mathematical footing. If this trend continues it could be very beneficial to biology's growth. Just look what math did for physics. Without a standard and univerally understood language, physics would be nowhere near where it is today. It's amasing to think how flexible numbers are at describing the world. It's mind-blowing that something so simple can even begin to describe what we see around us everyday.</p>
        <p>But, then again, I've been told that I think too much.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Update: Venter Interview</h3>
        <p>I don't particularly like the guys views on genetic protein patenting, but he's a genious nonetheless. Wired has an <a title="Wired 10.12: Supermicrobe Man" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/supermicrobe.html">interview</a><br />
        with him concerning the press release that I posted earlier today.<br /></p>

        <h3 class="title">Genetic Research Rant</h3>
        <p>I've been waiting for news of <a title="Scientists Planning to Make New Form of Life (washingtonpost.com)" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17496-2002Nov20.html">this</a> to comeout for some time now. Genomic research is so misunderstood and undiservingly feared.</p>
        <p>The potential benefits simply outweigh the oportunity for abuse. Detractors often cite these type of projects as being similar to the atomic bomb. I don't see any one complaining about how low our oil prices are compared to other countries, or how low our electricity bills are. Nuclear reactors are a necessity now in our energy dependent society. And without prior research in to harnassing nuclear energy that was developed during the Manhattan Preject, we arguably wouldn't have these power plants.</p>
        <p>The Bomb is a terrible use of technology, but I still don't see Iraq just up and dropping one on Saudi Arabia. Nor, do I see it happening anytime soon. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. never got into open conflict simply because of it's tremendous power. Looks like a war deterrent to me. We have some crazy people in this world, but not many are that crazy. To get enough people together for a project of that kind of magnatude would require, MANY insane individuals. Hello, top that off with the fact that most mental instablities have an added side effect of some form isolation. So, now, how do you get a bunch of nutballs together. Go to a mental ward and you will see what I mean.</p>
        <p>Also, many advocates say that such meddling in sacreligious and should be banned. I agree it is obviously in direct conflict with most religious views and consideration has been carefully taken to avoid claims of heresy, but science is a secular endevor. And, as such, is not confined by the conservative views of theology. The arguement that humans should not play God, is absolutley absurd in my opinion, because if we weren't supposed to; why then were we given this knowledge in the first place? And just why would we have a will to carry out such disputablely, reckless undertakings?</p>
        <p>Conversely, Why not? To deny ourselves of our intelectual persuits, is to deny ourselves of the very thing which protects us from extiction.</p>
