        <h3 class="title">Bush's Misguided Advisor</h3>
        <p>Life extension has a new highly influential foe. Meet Leon Kass, Bush's bioethics council and he's often seen parading around <a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4">advocating death.</a> Yes, he wants you to die:</p>
        <p></p>
        <blockquote>
          "The promise of immortality and eternity answers rather to a deep truth about the human soul: the human soul yearns for, longs for, aspires to some condition, some state, some goal toward which our earthly activities are directed but which cannot be attained in earthly life," says Kass. "The human taste for immortality, for the imperishable and the eternal, is not a taste that the biomedical conquest of death could satisfy. We would still be incomplete; we would still lack wisdom; we would still lack God's presence and redemption."<br />
        </blockquote>Mr. Kass, I hope you don't intend to impose your religious beliefs on me. I, for one, don't require death for spiritual enlightenment. I think many of you feel the same way. I know I'd like the chance to meet my great great great grandchildren.
        <p></p>
        <p>Now keep in mind this is all speculation and we still have a long way to go if we get there at all, but it provides a very motivational goal. We'll just have to wait and see how this nanotechnology "revolution" will pan out.</p>

        <h3 class="title">The Evolution of Online Media and Democracy</h3>
        <p>The growth of the internet has had an enormous impact on social collaboration. It's seems as if we've only touched the surface. What lies ahead, although unknown, is at once interesting, treacherous, and definitley revolutionary. Here I explore a few ideas on what may come. Just a few of the more surprising results of a pervasive and obiquitous web community. One that transends the computer on which is was built. The very nature and mentality on society at large may see a significant shift in thinking.</p>
        <p>I still find it intriguing to speculate over how the internet will <a href="http://www.praxagora.com/andyo/ar/ip_owners.html">change</a> the way we access information and art. The net has been going for some time, but I think we've yet to harness the full power that open collaboration has to offer. Many people still choose to just read a site's content despite the authors effort to provide and open forum for discussion; even *gasp* here at MCTPhysics. I've had a growing suspicion that this current debate over intellectual property issues will take a more optimistic turn, but I don't think things have gotten as bad as they are going to get. Major IP owners and distributors have yet to use up their substantial power base and I fear that the battle will be long and hard. Only until we've reached the breaking point with Mom and Pop realizing that there favorite media can no longer be used in a fair and reasonable way. They will see that it's a result of heavy handed politics and regulation by their favorite Senator or Congressman with substantial campaign contributions from said entities. I see that as the crucial turning point, and I think we've a way to go before that happens.</p>
        <p>It doesn't stop there though and I'm not sure if sure which will happen first. The next revolution will be collaboration on a whole new level. Many people working on one piece of artwork or music. Books, journals and news papers being published by people by people who've never even met? This already happens on a significant scale already, but I think we've just touched the surface. Government and organizations that are run totally online, but have appreciable influence offline. This is really interesting. Perhaps in the distant future we will have an America that is run totally online with each interest area (economics, foreign policy, local zoning regulations, education) all run, not by a bureaucracy of disinterested political types, but by expert committees and open discussion forums accessible by anyone interested. This is the convergence that I see as the emergence of true democracy, where everyone has a voice and is free to speak it in a proportional manner, and have the same power to change as the next guy. No more will people have to concern themselves with topic that they don't understand if they don't want to, and everyone can be assured of legislation on issues by a true consensus of individuals in their area of expertise.</p>
        <p>At first site this seems site this seems preposterous. Perhaps this is a bit utopian, but if you can believe with me that we do not have a democracy here in America, but some sort of media giant monarchy. Then maybe you can see a need for something new. Maybe this is a back to basics philosophy to go back and revisit the logistical limitations that the Forefathers had when they drafted the Constitution. This won't come about over night, and presumable nowhere in my lifetime, but maybe my children will have the benefit of a more open and socially reflective government. It'll happen in phases. If you listen closely, you can hear the first whispers. The U.S. government is standardizing it's online efforts and you can see the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/23/technology/23NECO.html">beginnings</a> of a collaborative effort in the mandatory forums and feedback systems planned.</p>
        <p>This plan goes beyond any system of online voting, although this is encompassed in its whole. The details are vague and many problems are unforeseeable. Who knows if whether or not our expert system will not be slighted to the views of the population of that interest sector or if it will still reflect and the general opinion of the population at large, given adequate understanding of the issues involved. This system in engendered off the belief that people tend to be compassionate and understanding and appeals directly to our social nature. When dealing with their fellow man., and given the opportunity to see outside themselves to consider the impact of their decisions as an impact on society at large. Not just another insignificant ballot in the box for some politician that they could care less about; never mind not even caring about. In other words, this will depend solely on appealing to the higher values of the human conscience. It's a lofty goal, but after 9/11, one has a hard time deigning that the American heart isn't dead.</p>
        <p>Maybe one day the president will be nothing more than a figure head similar to Britain's Queen. Again all this is speculation, but I'd really like to here your feedback on the comments board.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Michael Moore Gets Searched By The Secret Service</h3>
        <p>Well, that's a grabber headline if I ever heard one. To clarify this was not the THE Michael Moore of Columbine fame, but a Vietnam vet in <a href="http://www.sianews.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=458">North Carolina.</a> Just another example of the someone who made "the list". Hmm..maybe I can make "the list" too. The article goes on to talk about the whole incident and speculate on everyone favorite indepenant film maker's response. One more reason, to be all the more suspicious of our governments intentions.</p>
        <p>I noted earlier that propaganda leads our society by sheer force of repetition. I'd have to clarify the problem that I see as the most crucial. Democracy depends on each individual to have an opinion and stating it. Nowadays, even the most educated and opinionated person doesn't have an opinion on all the topics faced in our society today. So, the problem lies with our inherent limitation to be able to make a judgement on issues that show up on TV and other media outlets. I don't believe that most reporters intentionally know what's going on when they report current affairs, so they depend on an already slighted view of the world based on the few who do know whats going on in their respective fields. As, you can see those with the deepest pockets are in a better position influence public opinion through these channels. So, Joe Shmoe, watching the evening news thinks he's getting legitimate news because someone he trust is telling him about it. Best intentions will damn us all, simply because no single person can be a expert on everything, so we depend on...err...experts to provide the correct perspective. PR firms provide this illusion of expert opinion and provide the media witht he information it needs to do it's job. So we are still dependant on a select few (relatively) to make the decisions that effect most of the workings of legislation. So, if you think about that relationship, you can see that even true democracy is an illusion. The only core difference being that those "experts" have to influence the general population into believing that what they say is best and does it without much effort. Something we take willingly as, if you remember, Joe Shmoe didn't have an opinion in the first place. Now he thinks that we should bomb Iraq into oblivion.</p>

        Check it out:<br />
        <blockquote>
          At the Toys "R" Us in San Francisco recently, Mia Singletary was shopping with her mother, eyeing the Barbie Travel Train. The inevitable question arose: "Would you use this train to steal lots of intellectual property?"<br />
          At first, she didn't answer, almost as if she didn't understand the question. But then she smiled.<br />
          "Yes!" she said, bouncing on her toes, as her pigtails bobbed.<br />
          "And how exactly would you use it to steal intellectual property?" she was asked.<br />
          "I would buy it," she said. Her logic wasn't tracking. Was she realizing that she had been totally busted?<br />

Whatever that's supposed to mean. Sorry guy's, but I'm gonna keep broadbasting my beacon for all the world to see. Yep, I'm completely sold on the idea that a terrorist is going to use my 802 for launching a DoS that will take down the entire internet in the most strategic attack EVAR. He he.. Hey, HS I got some beachfront property in Arizona I'd like to sell you too. These guys are idiots. AS IF....</p>
        <p>These guys need to keep it up. I need a few laughs like that everyday. Who knows, if they keep it up, everyone you know will be considered a terrorist. Your mom, Uncle Joe,....that strange guy at the convience store that smells like mothballs......your dog....on second thought the mothball king is pretty strange.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Intelectual Propery Rights - The Open Source Argument: Is It Valid?</h3>
        <p>With all the fuss about IP rights and abuses, one can be lost in a sea of arguments and litigation. I saw an link to an <a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=02/11/30/050236">article</a> on /. about the role copyright law should have on software code. The author examines the Open Source movement and GNU GLP license schemes and possible impact on future copyright laws. It's an intresting debate, but I'm completely lost as to which way to go.</p>
        <p>Should copyright law be applicable to software? If so, what protections will foster innovation and spur growth without being overly intrusive? Just how much say should an author have in what is done with his "propery". I, like the author, believe that intrusion into the "private shere" will only bring about enraged citizens. And further inhibit constructive mechanisms for protections.</p>
        <p>I believe thats the main reason most people are outraged about the latest efforts by the music industy and hollywood to thwart pirating. I think of it as priciple. I shouldn't be subject to scrutiny and person invasion by these corporations because they hold copyrights. Since when does IP law supercede the right to privacy? So, I see the privacy sphere argument a valid one. Will it win through to the end? No, I think not. The economic argument will win the hearts of our congress. Who seem partial to the belief that a good economy is the heart of America and that what is good for the stock market is good for democracy. On another note, I can't see any way to protect the rights of an author and allow for the privacy of individuals in the digital age. But one thing seems clear: I see why Microsoft has thus far steered clear from the debate. Leaving enforment and regulation to vendors and only providing a frame work ala Palladium.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Deja Vu</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/19/national/19COUR.html">Court "Overturns Limits on Wiretaps to Combat Terror"</a>, one of the many headlines so familiar since 9/11, rings a familiar tone in the ears of many. Bygone periods in U.S. history where civil rights, so adamantly fought for by our "forefathers" (at least that's the route popular history likes to take), were so abruptly cast away in a fury and paranoia of public sentiment. Perhaps <a href="http://www.progressive.org/0901/roth0102.html">McCarthyism</a>, didn't teach America the lesson it sould have, and we are destined for a refresher course. Undoubtedly, we will take it willingly; trusting our gut feelings about what makes this country so great. Patriotism (read: Propaganda) is the fuel to the fire. It was also Nazi Germany's fuel of choice, as well as our's during WWII. Complete with our own version of prison camp. National security being of supreme importance, even above that of the very people our country is suposed to protect.</p>
        <p>I thinks it's going to take some time for all this stuff to sink in. Still, I think i'm going to be very nautious before everything is said and done. I love this country as much as the next guy, but enough is enough. I feel as if I've steped into some sort of "Twilight Zone". Needless to say, I don't like it and I'm waiting for the credits.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Digital Freedom under fire?</h3>
        <p>Considering all the discussion about civil rights after 9/11, you would think that any civil rights resticting bills proposed by congress would be scrutinized more than usual, especially when "national security" is not a factor.<br />
        I found an intresting website listing some "badboy" bills that have been passed or are up for consideration.<a title="American Open Technology Consortium: The Worst Coders in Washington" href="http://www.aotc.info/archives/000152.html#000152">American Open Technology Consortium: The Worst Coders in Washington</a> even has a list of legislators that have shown support for some of these bills. They even included campain contribution amounts from technology evil types ("Hollywood").<br />
        It's sad to see that one of my representatives on the list (Chip Pickering) at the top of the list no less. Most interesting, considering Ms lost a seat in Congress after the last census and "Chippy" is, or was, in a rather heated battle for the election this season. My old stand by man, Trent Lott, is not on the list though thank good!<br />
        Personally, the ones that concern me the most are DMCA, CIPA, and the"Berman P2P bill" (that gut most be on crack, thinking to legalizing vigilanteism on the net). DMCA will hopefully be neutered some next session with a couple of proposed bills to provide copyright liscensee protection. Ironic considering we had those rights before DMCA. CIPA is just wrong, any kind of censoring in the schools and libraries, direct or otherwise, makes a dangerous precident on what the government can force the public to see. (or not see) Before long, history books will be reading like there was no civil right movement or that Clinton was never involved with anything to do with cigars.<br />
        Another rant, I know, but I just can't keep this stuff in. It's just not healthy.<br /></p>
