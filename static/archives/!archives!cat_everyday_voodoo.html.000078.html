        <p>Ok, so it's been a while. I haven't dropped off the face of the earth, I've just moved on to other things. I still plan to keep the site up and update it from time to time. School starts in a month or so and I'm all excited. Perhaps I'll have some more to write about then. News hounding is not my forte, as It just consumes too much of my time. Time better spent with my family and gaming of course.</p>
        <p>Maybe one day, I'll have a clear idea of what I want this website for, but for now, I'll stick to bad grammer and ill concieved rants.</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah. I just got Star Wars Galaxies for my birthday. I'll check back in with the verdict and a play guide that I'm working on when I get it finished.</p>

        <p>Well, yes, it seems the Everquest bug has hit me very hard. I'm not quite sure when I will recover, but it seems to have subsided long enough for me to read my email ans sleep, among other things. The bad news came about 2 weeks ago when I recieved a dissapontingly thin letter from MIT. So, alas, I didn't get in. I'll be attending a local university, USM, next fall. I'm not too crushed by the admissions decision because at least I'll be at home and have a much more managable tuition expense. (I wonder if I could possibly put together a more uncoherent post?)</p>
        <p>Other news has it, that I have been having problems with the site. (hence, the long over due post.) I hope that the past problems have been corrected and you can contiue read about my endless search for exciting, geeky, and altogether pointless news right here at MCTPhysics.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Slow News</h3>
        <p>Hopefully I'm not the only one wondering why the news has been so slow lately. Nevertheless, despite the mediocre tempo as of late, I would be amiss if I didn't mention the recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,57245,00.html">announcement</a> by Microsoft to pay out dividends. A first for the software giant and maybe a prelude of things to come from other technology companies, which have traditionally refrained from paying dividends. Instead, they have usually chosen to reinvest all earning back into R&D to further fuel growth. I suspect this move by MS is to change it's investor base to align it's value with more conservative investors and affirm its long term value. I might even go so far as to say that maybe this signals a more "mature" Microsoft. However knowing Microsoft, it's probably just more marketing than financial strategy.</p>
        <p>Now if only I could find something more significant to report.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Word of Hope for the Moment</h3>
        <p>I've finally gotten through with my application to MIT. All that there is to do is sit back and wait until spring. And as fate would have it, because of a less than impressive showing on the SAT's, I've began to have doubts as to why I would even try and apply. Thankfully, I'm no pretentious high school kiddie, but have had my share of disappointments whenever it came to scholastic endeavors. However, as of late, I've been feeling the heat of anxiety and the foreboding presence of impending disappointment. Call it insecurity, call it normal jitters, but whatever it is. I don't like it. I was uplifted earlier this week when I read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58951-2002Dec31.html">this article</a> at the Washingtom Post. Hey, normally I don't go for this kind of "feel good" type of writing, but I've found it really uplifting. It's about a research group that does a study of applicants that got denied admission to there "Dream" college. What they found was that even though they weren't given the brand name college treatment; they still did just as well as those that did get accepted. They call it the Spielberg Effect for reason that soon become obvious. Now, common knowledge has it that this is no new revelation, but it's still striking to see it coming from a regimented study.</p>
        <p>Also of note is <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html">another article</a> that rubbed me right. For the time being, I'll have to settle with the little bit of consolation I get from these articles until I get the verdict because no amount of intellectualizing will subdue me from biting at my nails. Wish me luck ;)</p>

        <h3 class="title">More Site Features</h3>
        <p>As you see, I've have yet another site design. It's nothing major, just a few CSS tweaks. I like the general layout, so I won't be changing that. I just wanted something that was a little easier on the eyes and that still provided a definite structure to the news post without being so rigid looking. The change in fonts helps in readablity, while a change in the hyperlinks' formatting cleans up the text. I standardized the font size; choosing to use a fixed "px" value instead of the more general "normal", "x-small", etc. values. I noticed that the different browsers were displaying the text size much differently. Using a fixed pitch solved the sizing problems, and now you should see this site's text at the size they were intended.</p>
        <p>A few people have noted that the text size was too small. That should solve the problem, but to insure that the more visually impaired reader can see the text; I've included a simple script to change the text size of each post either smaller or larger to suit each individual's tastes. You can do this with most browsers in the options, but I some people don't know how to do this. Besides that, it gave me an excuse to use my new found Javascript skills. All you need to do is click the apropriate link on the navbar to change the text size. I'll post the script later in another article for those of you that want to know how write the script.</p>
        <p>i just wonder how long this design will last...</p>

        <h3 class="title">Tweaking Site Layout</h3>
        <p>I've been messing around with the site layout in my never ending quest for perfection. Some of you (and by that, I mean most of you) are running IE in one of it's various versions. Despite careful plodding to the contrary, I couldn't coax it into display a "fixed" CSS element. So the little "Powered by ...Copyright" bar is displaying below the banner instead of floating fixedly on the bottom of the page. It's a limitation of IE the best I can tell. As this is a standards compliant (usually) web page, one might be quick to shun any user that complains about problems displaying the page. But I look at it this way: It just one more reason you should be running <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. It's free and you'll get the full benefit of knowing that your not perpetuating a software monopoly. Not to mention, see this site the way it was intended.</p>
        <p>I don't usually shun any one software solution over the other, but in this case I have to make an exception. I used to be an entrenched IE user. I really loved it. It was easy to use and a snap to extend with plugins. It didn't have that whole funky UI feel as it was designed by MS, so the experience was what I had become accostomed to. I've tried to use other browsers. I've used Opera, but after not even the first month I found myself going back to good old IE. I even tried Mozilla ealier only to get the same results: a less thatn optimal browsing experience. Fast forward to the 1.0 release of Mozilla. I read about the new release and decided to give it another go. Needless to say the "experiment" is still going. I just found myself using it contantly instead of me forcing myself to use it. I was drawn to it, especially after I discovered the new skin that came with it. I look back at IE now and wonder how I used such an old and bloated browser for so long. Just looking at the thing makes me cringe. I dread using the few apps that require IE as the default browser or engine to display web content. So, there you have itgo get Mozilla, if you can, download it, love it, worship it...</p>
        <p>Enough of the Mozilla plug, the reason I have the new footer is that I wanted to provided links to "document compliance" sites, but not display those funcky gifs they provided. I tend to favor text anyway. I never liked those flashy pics that didn't seem to fit in. Besides I'm no good at editing pictures, as I have no sense of aethetics. So the word is, as usual, if you want to get the most from this site. Go get a standards compliant browser, and see just how much better your internet surfing experience can be.</p>
        <p>This will be increasingly important as I start to add more DOM complant javascripting services on this site. Who knows maybe I'll make a Mozilla sidebar as an extra incentive.</p>

        <p>Everyones favorite genious, Ben Stein from "Win Ben Stein's Money" has written a nice piece on <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=64&amp;e=3&amp;u=/fo/20021213/bs_fo/2002_12_how_to_ruin_american_enterprise">"How to Ruin American Enterprise"</a>. It's right on the money I'd say. An excellent critique of the social decline currently underway in the public at large. The part about the school system playing to the lowest common denomenator is the most important aspect I my opinion. But don't forget about the march of legal action that has all but frozen innovation for fear of lawsuits. It is always the "other guy" you know.</p>
        <p>Mass market public relations has caused become so well integrated into our society that we actually think that wev'e succeeded in gaining free will. A milestone for PR firms (read: propaganda). Finally the government has a public that is content with the things that they see in the media and society today. Oblivious to the fact that we are now only brainwashed from massive repetion and blindly follow the suggestions of those that have the capital to finance big money campains: it doesn't matter if it's a new SUV or war in Iraq.</p>

        <p>The RIAA with all it spin doctoring and bogus claims have still yet to show any benefit for the music industry. <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20021216/0912254.shtml">TechDirt</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/28588.html">The Register</a> have reported on some of the evil organizations failed tactics to change public opinion. Despite all it's legal firepower, it has yet to show why it's "evidence" is valid. I <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1040056422.html">remember</a> reading an article about a recent raid that uncovered 420 or so cd burners, which after careful srutiny, amounted to ~150 high speed burners. Thats quite an exageration and the public at large is noticing, not to mention the legislature.</p>
        <p>Latest theory: The RIAA will colapse under it's own weight.</p>
        <p>I have a feeling that when everything is said and done. 5 or 10 years from now, there will be no public ear for the RIAA if they continue to push their bloated claims. I'm almost obliged to ignore all future RIAA press releases. Simply because to me their cries and moans are just the die throes of a mighty beast. I'm now fairly confident everything will work out in the end given time for the content industry to remodel their business model to a more progressive form. forget all the concern over user rights and piracy raising prices. They'll be short lived if they even happen at all. I have a feeling that RIAA won't last that long.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Blog Enlightenment</h3>
        <p>Web design can sometimes be a pain. The standards are always changing and you never knowif the end user is going to see your web page as you intended. There's also the concern that your site in not easily accessable to your readers because as time goes by it becomes increasingly difficult to manage your content and provide and easy to use interface for navigation. Often times this leads to frequent redesigns and/or useless features. I've most certainly been guilty of being overly insecure about my design/website in the past. I've also seen my share of doubts as to what I should post and what is better left to other sites to report. It's all to easy to forget about the mission or purpose of your site. Lesson #1 - It's one thing to write a mission statement; it's another to actually adhear to it.</p>
        <p>I've recently been learning about DHTML and I recently ran across a site that has some very useful (and easy to understand) tips on web design. The site is <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/main.html">A LIST APART</a>. I'm still reading through the site, but I ran a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/writeliving/">blogging article</a> with some disturbingly simple tips on how to write consistently and well. Hence, my little bit of self reflection. I hope you fellow bloggers out there find it useful. It was an eye opener for me.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Reflections on Japan</h3>
        <p>I often think about what it was like to live in Japan. I'm usually baffled at an explaination. It's on the tip of my tongue, but it still eludes me. Sometimes I'm asked, "What was it like to live there?", usually replying, "cool" or "incredible". It's like a fantasy world, were somehow Hello Kiity on dump trucks make sense and personal expression make new highs (and lows). I would say that it is "another world", but the would be horribly inadequate.</p>
        <p>So, I was reading v-2, and came across a <a href="http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=223">post</a> that reminded me of a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.09/gibson.html">Wired article</a> about Japan. I've yet to find anything that comes close to what it was like. These come terribly close however.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Relief for Your Computing Obsession</h3>
        <p>Anybody who spends a signifigant time behind the computer will agree that often times it can be painful. Many people that spend thier waking hours typing on the keyboard have found that they start losing feeling in their hands and start experiencing pains away from the computer. Common tasks like opening a door become a dreaded affair because of the painful effect. Carpal Tunnet Syndrome (CTS) has gotten plenty of meadia attention. Still many don't know why they are experiencing pain, although there are many effective and inexpensive treatments that could aleviate most of the symptoms. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars</a> has a review up about the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1039505698.html">IMAK Smart Glove</a>, a product to help protect your wrist from further injury while allowing them to heal.</p>
        <p>Many people have this problem, but a few have a different problem called Cubital Tunnel Syndrom. The main difference in symptoms is that the numbness primarily occurs on the ring and pinky finger. It is caused by inflamation on a nerve that travels through the elbow as apposed to the wrist. The most effective treatment is simple to not rest your elbow on anything to relieve the pressure and inflamation. Along with freaquent breaks, many see full recovery.</p>
        <p>I can testify to it simply because I have this problem. When at it's worst I could hardly use my right hand for anything, it was simply to weak and the pain was unbearable. I had tried all the techniques for relief for CTS, but they weren't effective. I finally went to the doctor and he informed me of CuTS. It took me a while to get used to not resting my elbow as I typed, but after a while I became more aware of my elbow position. I also took frequent breaks away from the keyboard to straighten my arm. After about 3 weeks my pain went away and, after about 3 months, I recieved full feeling back to my hand. There is relief to these problems, but it requires a little change to your routine. The change was well worth it though. Don't forget to talk to your doctor about it.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.v-2.org/index.php">v-2 Organisation</a> has a link up to a rather interesting article about well, simply put, <a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/sociology/soc082bd.html">mobility</a>. I'm still struggling to internalize it all, but it's well worth the read. I've put off posting this for a while, simply because my brain has been refusing to cooperate with me the past few days. And yet still I'm still lacking in something intelligent to say about it. I think I feel a cold coming on. I'm still waiting find something worth talking about here, but there's nothing in the news worth mentioning.</p>
        <p>Perhaps something will come up.</p>

        <p>This is the best case of geeks justice of all time. Long story short: spammer does interview with DFP, interview is /.ed, readers retaliate by signing spammer up for mailing list and catalogs via snail mail spam, spammer vows to seek retribution in court. But don't take my word for it. I think Ars didn't a much better job. I nearly fell out of my seat laughing when I got news of this.

        <p>Shanghai, China - <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993153">Engineers</a> have built the world first maglev passenger train. It will be used to transport passengers from Pudong Internation Airport and Shanghai's financial district covering 30 Km in 7 minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, No matter how you look at it that's fast. In testing the train reached a speed of 312 mph, but the passenger version will travel at 250 mph. Remember this a train, not a car or plane, a train. You know, those big hulking beasts. And this one can go nearly half the speed of sound! That's simply amazing.</p>
        <p>Also in other news, our good friends across the Pacific have worked out Pi to an unprecedented accuracy: 1.24 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-2223732,00.html">Trreellleeoonn</a> places. The previous record was 158 billion places. Mind-blowing!</p>

        <p>I'm not sure this should even be a "Technology Journal" at all. It's seems that I'm off topic as much as I'm on. Alas, It's my blog so I'll do what I want. (damnit!) hehe. Well since I've obviously commited another of these sins, perhaps I sould share with you why. Yes, I think I shall.</p>
        <p>I've been reading <a href="http://v-2.org/index.php">v-2 Organisation</a>. I'm not exactly sure why, but I have despite a rather unlikely marrage of architural critique and prada fetish <a href="http://v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=21">contained</a> therein. And let us not forget to mention the logical and obligatory robot <a href="http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=215">discussion</a>. As if you couldn't tell; I like this page, although I'm not sure I share his passion for <a href="http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=212">fonts</a>. Not to metion I just wish I had the same eye for site design, but you can't have eveything can you. I'll be adding this lovely piece of heaven to daily rotation and I recommend you do the same.</p>
        <p>Now how do I carry over the general site design and feel with out totally ripping it off. I'll have to work on that one. Ack! Another project in my overly fragmented schedule.</p>

        <p>Sorry for not posting today. The internet has been really slow today. So, I haven't been able to get around very well today to get the news. It's really frustrating, and I hopefully it'll clear up soon. I've also been trying to download the Sun java IDE. I've yet to get a download speed faster than 1KB. Eww, this is driving me crazy. I'm tired of these servers not giving me the time of day, because I'm on dialup. I hope you all enjoy your broadband connections...NOT! LOL</p>

        <p>Testing once again. This time with <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">Newz Crawler</a>. I found it by looking for a RSS new reader. I just couldn't believe it was so hard to find a 3 panel outlook style RSS new reader. I mean come on! Sometimes these programmer types are pretty dense when it come to UI's and aesthetics. I thought it reasonably obvious for someone to read news this way. It's only logical to be able to select your feed, see a list of news items on that feed, and have a preview pane to see the full description.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, I'm in love with this news app. It's a welcome departure from the usual "scroll forever because all the feeds are displayed in one long list" type of readers that seem to be so predominate as of late.</p>
        <p>It also includes a blogging client. The one I'm posting with right now.</p>
        <p>The previous post was done with <a href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.Bloggar</a>. Which is a blogging client only. I'll be evaluating both over the next few days. I do have one beef already though. Newz Crawler isn't free, which severly inhibits my choices. Simple because I don't have a Job, so no steady income for me. My luck I'll end up loving it and can't live without it. We'll see.</p>

        <p>It seems that my site is a stopping point along the way to the <a title="Welcome to The Stone" href="http://commons.thestone.com/">Enigma</a>! Numerous referals have been recorded in my server logs of people coming from this site. My best guess is that they are playing that internet game. The game is a mystery that you solve by using the internet to research with each mystery providing a clue to the "Enigma". What that is I don't know, but I did do one of the puzzles. Mine was on the Chupacabras. Of course, I didn't know that when I started though, but it was pretty easy to figure out.</p>
        <p>The site was pretty freaky though. When I first got there I thought it was some kind of "new age" site. The site is still a little unnerving though, why I don't know. Kind of reminds me of that whole Blair Witch stuff a few years back.</p>

        <h3 class="title">DoE and Artifcial sight team up</h3>
        <p>The Department of Energy has commited to contibuting $3 million over 3 years to <a title="Office of Science - Feature Articles - Artificial Retina Project" href="http://www.science.doe.gov/feature_articles_2002/November/Artificial_Retina/PF_Artificial-Retina.htm">artificial retina research</a>.</p>
        <p>An artificial retina works by implanting an electrode array on the back of the eye to stimulate the nerves that carry the signals the brain where it is processed to produce the images we see everyday. This has been done before in limited form, usually consisting only a few (~16) electrodes, to allow a patient with retinal disease to see the presence or absence of light. Plans to use more (~1000) electrodes will allow a person to see images; albiet in a very limited form.</p>
        <p>I can't wait to get an enhancment implant. I would love to be able to see in the dark or see light out of the visual spectrum. I know that to that would require a way to represent the extra information (other wavelengths outside the visible), as our brains don't readily process those spectrums, but I'm sure someone will figure it out.</p>
        <p>I suppose it'll be a while before the technology is refined enough to allow for aesthetic motivations, but it'll come one day. I'll be first in line, of course along with my memory implant too.</p>

        <p>Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>
        <p>The holiday guantlet has begun. I can just smell the stuffing and gravy, ham and turkey. Mmmm, I can almost feel the fat growing just thinking about it.</p>
        <p>I've spent the last few holiday seasons overseas. It's hard to believe that this is my first Thanksgiving back home with my family in 3 years. I'd almost gotten used to staring at the barrack's walls during Chrstmas and Thanksgiving. It was always fun looking forward to cookie day. Needless to say, the holidays sux in the Marines in Okinawa. Well, for me they did. Not that I didn't like Japan, but,...errr,... you know what I mean. Jeez!</p>
        <p>Anyway, I won't be online for a while. I'll be back afterwards, though, for a little more Tech goodness. But in the meantime, I'm going to pretend that the keyboard is not surgically grafted to my arms and spend some time with the family. I wonder how long I can go without touching the computer, before I break down in to tears. Hmm, rough guess....a few daaa....minutes. I know I'll do fine. I'm gonna cheat. I'm bringing my digital camera. He he.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I wish everyone a safe and enjoyable holiday.</p>

        <h3 class="title">The Sims on Time</h3>
        <p>I never thought I would see the day that big media would put games in a good light. The Time website has an article up about the Sims. More specificly The Sims Online. The author says something about SimAmerica or something like that. Must everyone make an analogy out of anything and everything. Well, <a title="TIME.com: Sim Nation" href="http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,391544,00.html?cnn=yes">here</a> it is.!</p>

        <p>I found this on Slashdot. It seems RadioShack has finally <a href="http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2002/11/25/daily4.html">stopped</a> being so nosy. They have finally wisened up and stopped asking for your address and phone number when you check out. It always bothered me that they would ask, even when you only went there for a connector or something equally trival. I always told them; "I rather not.". But it was bothersome nonetheless.</p>

        <p>Yet another blog that I'll be adding to my bookmarks.</p>
        <p><a title="Potlatch - the Gift Economy" href="http://www.potlatch.net/">Potlatch - the Gift Economy</a></p>
        <p>Again, moving in the political direction, but it's got some articles on technology impact. Specifically DRM.</p>
        <p>EDIT: Notice the entry there about the Indonesian government and the US and Australian involvment. Here's a <a href="http://pilger.carlton.com/print/119612">link</a> to that article. I can vouch for most everything said. I was there and believe me, the "humanitarian" operation there was a big fat JOKE. I went on the first LCU in to setup communications. It was immediately obvious, that given the resources we had, this "operation" was going to be just a training exercise. Furthermore, I began to wonder what exactly was the US trying to do. If we weren't here for aid, the why would they send us, execpt to give an appearance of simpathy. Hindsight is much clearer now, than it was then.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Unsure?</h3>
        <p>I'll settle on a title for the site one day. Notice that today's incaration is slightly less misleading. I don't want someone to come here thinking that this is a FAQ site or something along those lines. That's one of my pet peeves when it comes to the web. It's so hard to find the information you are looking for because no one is explicit in their site description. W3C has discused this at much length and has built in features to help. But, It does no good when people choose to ignore it though. I guess false advertising has it's merits. Hey, just look at PoRn sites. Preme-O example! I think they are the only ones that still use those content META tags.</p>
        <p>Yes, still no news worth mentioning. Why else do you think that I would be talking about META tags, porn and website titles. I gotta write something though. I can't let another moment pass in which I could otherwise be doing something useful. Proper time managment is over-rated you know.</p>
        <p>Enough already, the whole world is asleep, but me. Everyone over at Ars OpenForum is anyway. Excepting perhaps the hacker guys, they've always got something up their collective sleeve. No one emails me any more. Not even my own sister....HELLO! I know you're busy at work, but I'd like to here from you. Hell, I'd be happy with a blank message for that matter.</p>
        <p>//me thinks I'll stop talking now... before I say something really stupid.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Daily Update</h3>
        <p>It's been a crazy week in tech this week. A lot happened and I hope it continues. In other news; the most searched for term to hit this site: caffeinated soap! That's right, of all the things that could bring someone here to this site; The most popular is about soap. Geek soap, but still soap nonetheless. Who'd a thunk it!</p>
        <p>It's seems as if there's nothing going on this weekend, so things have been really slow. I decided to *gasp* leave the computer and go see some family. It's good to be back, though. Because, I don't want any of my family to get used to me helping out around the house. So I needed to get back home before they could find some new project for me to do. :)</p>
        <p>That's right I'm a lazy bum. And proud of it too.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Site navigation improved</h3>
        <p>I've been working on improving the site navigation. I was trying to make it a little more logical. Now clicking on the individual entry's header will take you to that single entries archive page with the comments that have been posted displayed on the same page. Also, the calender days now only link to that that single day's entries. And, of course the other links off to the right, correspond to their respective listing.</p>
        <p>If you noticed before, most links went to a monthly archive. And consequentely, it took a long time to load. You can still do that now if you want to, but it's not enforced on all the links, only the ones for monthly archives. And the same for Category links. Err, you get the idea. On to better news.</p>
        <p>I finally changed the banner, to reflect more accuratley what this site is about. I don't want anyone misled by the title and coming here thinking it's about military research, or other things of that nature, as Google seems to be doing when searched for by the previous title. The title was never meant to be "The Proving Grounds", it was just for development. Before that it was, "The Testing Grounds", so you can kinda see were I got that from. It was only to reflect the level of refinement that I thought the site had obtained. It was never meant to be up so long, but I had grown quite fond of it. But now it's time to move on.</p>
        <p>I still don't have a graphic. I'm not a real "artsy" type person, so please someone help me out here. I'm fresh out of idea's. So, until I find something I like, we will continue with the text only version. Which I think looks surprisingly good, in it's own right.</p>
        <p>By the way, this site is designed to be viewed at 1024X786 resolution AT LEAST! I use 1280X1024, kinda weird but it's the default resolution on my LCD. So, if your not looking at this site by those stardards, your doing yourself a grave misjustice. I saw my site at 800X600 and it looks just horrible, text all grainy and otherwise nasty looking. Frankly, I don't see how people use a computer at such low res. I'll go nuts using it and trying to work on a computer. You can't read anything at that resolution. Well you can, but it look horrendous and you'll end up scrolling for days just to read one article in most websites.</p>
        <p>For those of us less fortunate, and don't know what I'm talking about or don't know how to change their resolution. It's really easy on a Windows machine. Right click on the desktop, yeah, the one that probably has a horrible picture as a background because you haven't changed the windows default</p>
        <p>Go to "Settings", and there is a slider on the lower left. Moving it to the left makes the resolution change lower, (mental note where is now, before you change it) and moving it right makes the resolution higher.</p>
        <p>Most machines you can only change it to safe resolutions, so don't worry about messing things up. Notice the number listed below the slider, that's the resolution you currently have selected. Bump the slider up a couple of notches 'till you get at least to 1024 (FYI, The first number is the how many dots are displayed horizonally (left to right) and the second is the number vertically (Top to bottom). You can get an idea of what the screen will look like after you change it, by looking at the little picture.</p>
        <p>If you can, change the color depth to 32 with the dropdown window to the right (the one with the line of colors below it), it'll let you see more colors (than if your set to 16 or 24). If you can'just use the highest one you can. Then click apply, it may ask you if you want to test the settings first, click yes.</p>
        <p>Yeah, the screen will go blank or do some kind of test screen, you didn't mess any thing up. The new settings should now be applied, and your screen will look much different (read: better). If you see anything messed up or just got a blank screen the whole time. You set the settings to high and it'll either ask you if you want to change back or keep the new settings or it'll do it automatically.</p>
        <p>If it looks good, keep 'em, if not click no. Play around with the settings untill you find the ones you like, just remember to click "apply", not "ok", so you can test your settings first. Now enjoy your new, persective on computing. It should now be a LOT easier to read web pages. and other things of that nature.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Comments?</h3>
        <p>I was wondering about how to improve the site. I would really like to see some more participation. However, I don't know If people see the "comments" button below each post or if 'netizens are just inherently consumers. Any way, the comments below each news post are free and easy to use. I only require an email address. Don't worry, I hate it when companies sell my email address to spammers, so I won't do the same. Beside, as you can see, this site is supported out of my own funds rather than advertising. Note the lack of ads and banners. I plan to keep it that way, if at all possible.</p>
        <p>I just think that if people participate, the site will be much more lively. I would like to have a little community if at all possible. If you don't like the way the comments are being implemented and would like to see something else. Just tell me. I've been toying with the idea of linking a discussion forum to each post, instead of the comments. But, I'm not going to do it if no one is going to use it. It cost me money to buy another MySQL DB to host on this site, not to mention the hassle of seting it up with my posting engine. But I'll do it if I think it will be used.</p>
        <p>Just tell me what you think.</p>
        <p>Personally, I think the current setup is fine, but the forum will be more stuctured and flexible at the same time. But it will be harder to use, for most people I know. Just let me know. Yes!!, that means you!</p>

        <h3 class="title">More content to come.</h3>
        <p>I've been kicking around a few ideas for articles. I think I'll do one on the Particle/Wave duality. I have a pretty good understanding of it, so I think I know enough to write a coherent piece. It'll be targeted to the beginner. Hopefully, I can adequately explain some of the cooler aspects of physics. The stuff that got me interested. So, the requisite and oft' touted "2 slit experiment" will be presented in it's full glory (and wierdness).</p>
        <p>I fully expect this one to be much better than my Top Style review, which was horrible, at least in my opinion. (I'll be working on expanding and editing that one too.) If not then I'll just have to shoot myself or cut off my hands so I can't type anymore. I know I'm probably exagerating about how bad the article was, but, really, this one WILL be better. Scout's honor.</p>
        <p>Why do an article on physics? Well, because it what this site is about (duh). Just kidding, I'm doing it because I have some deep buring desire to evangelize everthing I do. Therefore, it's only logical I would write one on my biggest hobby. Also, I think the subject is terribly misunderstood. People should should know why this subject is SO interesting. And not just for a geek or math wiz.</p>
        <p>I think that when someone is properly exposed to some of the more intriguing aspects of modern (and classical for that matter) physics they will have no choice, but to want to know more. It's simply that addictive.</p>
        <p>(You can thank, Ray for that, Mikey! With those long talks in Hanbytown at the coffee shop.)</p>
        <p>'Till then, everyone will just have to put up with the reposted articles that I find thoughout my day. Although, some of them are quite good, I'd like to have at least a little original content. My comments are pretty good, but they do tend to get a little old after a while. Tech journal or not, I've got to find some little niche all my own, otherwise there would be no reason to come here. Especially, if you read the same sites as I do. I know what I really need. I need some "informants", yeah, thats should do the trick, "informants". I can see it now, I'll be able to say sometihng cool like "according to my sources" or have an informant named "deeptroat". Wait a minute, I think that one is already taken, but you get my drift.</p>
        <p>Maybe I'll contact Randall, 'bout getting some gaming news going on this site. I wonder how well he writes....</p>

        <p>On a related note, these guys are working on a <a title="infoSync : Wizards spell DooM for the Palm" href="http://www.infosync.no/show.php?id=2607">DooM</a> port for Palm OS. They say they can get about 10 FPS (frames per second) on Dragonball-based hardware. With ARM base systems they claim to have it running at 40 FPS. Whoot! I can just see all the geeks overclocking their palms for a little more frames. LOL! Not to mention all the MoDs that are sure to come. Ahh, it's good to be a geek.</p>

        It's nice to see someone actually using the feeds. Though, at first, I was a little perplexed as to why I was getting the newswire links in my server logs. How are they working?

        <p>Those of you who know me well, know that I am a huge fan of <a title="Ayumi Hamasaki" href="http://home.no.net/ayumi/">Ayumi Hamasaki</a>. If you've never heard of her then you should, she only the most remixed artist of all time. I learned of the Japanese Diva during my stay in Japan and soon fell in love.<br />
        OK, I'll stop oogling, but not until I tell you about her new trance mix album. (You can get it at <a href="http://us.yesasia.com/">YesAsia</a>.) Following in the sucess of the previous "CYBERTrance presents". AyuTrance 2 is a nonstop megamix, similar in style to those MEGA MIX albums so popular in Japan. I swear this stuff is like crack. And once you go JPop you never go back. Now all I got to do is survive through the torment and suspence as I wait for my copy. : (</p>
        <p>(JTow remember to tell Art, I'm sure he's still frothing at the mouth from the last time I mention this coming. Well, now it's here. So now he can rest easy, if that's possible?!)</p>

        <p>I swear. I'm only off the net for a week and it seems like forever. I'm having server problems right now, my host is doing something to the hardware right now. There's no telling, but it's been makeing my scripts respond like ass. Putting it nicely, that is.</p>
        <p>You religious zealots out there might have fun with <a href="http://www.selectsmart.com/RELIGION/">this</a>. It said I was a "Ultimate Unitarian or Nontheist, whatever that is. Please try not to take it too seriously.</p>
        <p>/. has a link up to a <a href="http://www.nik.com.au/alice/">conversation</a> between two ALICE bots. I almost fell out of my seat laughing at it. So don't say I didn't warn you. I also tried my hand at talking to ALICE, and personally I don't see what the big deal is about it. You know those intelectual types have to give "awards" to someone...right? Why not a guy who makes a bot capable of small talk? Seems their time would be better spent, coming up with their own unique ideas instead of critiquing other's. That's right, I don't think people need reconition and praise to be motivated.</p>
        <p>I went and saw Tool last weekend down on the coast. Disappointed is a major understatement. Seeing the Lead singer's ass the whole time, because he wouldn't turn around and stop facing the background screen, was far from entertaining. Especially after surviving "Mushugga", the opening act, and the obnoxiously loud music that insued therefter. I would normally take the fact that I thought the music was too loud as a sign that I'm getting to old, that is until I turn around a see the 17/18 year old teenyboppers with their hands over their ears. Also there's the fact that for about half an hour, we thought the band had walked out on us. No "were going to take a short break" or "we'll be back in a few" for us. Nope, he just walked off the stage in the middle of the show without even noticing the band of his departure. Prefering the let them figure it out themselves. And leaving the crowd without a clue. Wondering why did they pay $40 for a ticket to see this circus act. I love Tool, but ...Damn!</p>

        <h3 class="title">Problems displaying page?</h3>
        <p>Is anyone having problems displaying the page? I originally composed this site for IE 6 and it displays pages slightly different in terms of width calulation than the CSS spec. I'm looking at the page in Mozilla and the layout is all messed up. My sidebar, that's supposed to be on the right, shows up in floating somewhere in my content section. I'm not sure if it's a bug in Mozilla. but Amaya also doesn't display it properly either. I guess I'm be reading lots of stuff on CSS 2 and browser's rendering limitaions tonight. Well, if you notice anything, please contact <a href="mailto:derfuehrer@mctphysics.com">me</a> or feel free to comment.</p>
        <p>Also, I'm working on a logo graphic for the banner. Something to do with technology or physics. I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking for. But I'll know it when I see it. How 'bout some ideas, guys?</p>

        <p>It so sad that NASA, with all it prestige and respect, even takes the time to do this. Especially given their ,although large, tight budget. It seems that NASA is tired of all the claims by conspiracy theorists, zealots and crackpots, have been putting forth since even before the Apollo 11 astronauts set foot back on earth. NASA has <a title="Yahoo! News - No Apollo Moon Landing? NASA Book to Combat Doubts" href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=585&e=1&cid=585&u=/nm/20021105/sc_nm/space_moon_dc">commisioned</a> someone to compose a book with the sole purpose of convincing the "unbelievers" that NASA did in fact got to the moon, multiple times. A put a man there. Took pictures. Left footprints. Ahh...you get my drift.<br /></p>

        <p>I've finally reach a reasonably final state with the design of the site. I've tweaked the code to output valid XHTML, XML, and CSS documents. Check it out on the validation links to the right. The ones with the red checkmarks. They send you to the World Wide Web Consorium (W3C) validation service pages and automatically validate my site. Try it out. See, no errors at all! Not so much as a warning. Ain't I just super.</p>
        <p>Feel free to comment below on the changes I've made to the site. I love hearing from you.</p>
        <p>I've included a XML logo to my RSS feed, for those synication junkies. (You know who you are.)</p>

        <p>Well, I got a new MB. Asus A7V333. This board is sweet. Instalation was nearly flawless. I'm not sure if that is a indication of good skills or a good board, but my Tyan installation didn't go nearly as well. I still dread sending the thing off to be repaired though. Not just because I got to pay for it to be shipped. But because the sooner I get my Tyan back, the sooner I have to give up the Asus. (It's supposed to be used in another computer I'm building for my parents.)</p>
        <p>I took the SAT I today also. It was easier than I though it was going to be. I think I did well (not perfect though). I ran out of time on one of the math sections. The part that you have to fill in by hand. Oh well, time to prepare for the SAT II now. No time to be bummed out from missing a few questions.</p>

        <p>My favorite holiday of the year is now here. I can't wait to go see the new haunted houses this evening. Goblins, witches, mummies and ghosts all will be out and what better way to celebrate than to go out and enjoy the night. This is gonna be so much fun.</p>
        <p>Sorry for not posting in a while. I just can't stand working on this laptop, so I haven't been online in a while. Also I got some other things going on that require a little more of my time lately. But rest assured that I will soon be back in all my posting glory, ready to bewitch the masses with my unsatiable appetite for technology and science. "The Proving Grounds" will finally have graduated to a more fitting title. For those wondering, "The Proving Grounds" is only a temporary name. First there was "The Testing Grounds", a sort of Alpha test. Then came the current name which is a Beta test. And soon, I will give it it's final and permanent name, and the transition will be complete. Now all I "gots" to do is figure out what name that will be. Time will tell, and I'm in no hurry.</p>

        <p>It's always fun to wake up in the morning, smell the fresh morning dew, and think about what new and exciting thing are going to happen today.</p>
        <p>I didn't get to do that yesterday morning. I was too busy rushing to the power switch on my computer and ripping the case off to enjoy anything! Sometime early yesterday morning, the fans on my power supply went out and slowly roasted the internals of my PS. So what, big deal, replace the PS; you say. Well, replace the power supply I did. And, low and behold, I find out that; not only did the PS die a slow, and agonizing death. During it's last moments of pain, it decided to take my motherboard with it.</p>
        <p>So, I'm without my pride and joy, for what looks like a couple of weeks. Tyan seems to think I won't mind not having my computer for 2-3 weeks while they inspect the board, take it on a road trip, out to a nice dinner and a picnic in the park. Whilest I suffer the indignety that is laptop computing. I'm beginning to think I will not be buying Tyan again. Oh, and they want me to pay for shipping it to them.</p>

        <p>I received a letter from MIT today. They sent me the name of my interviewer. I originally thought I wasn't going to get one, because so few people from Mississippi go to MIT. Needless to say I was relieved. I started thinking about how I was going to contact them and setup me interview. Only problem is, she lives in Vicksburg, so it'll be a long drive for one of us. Not to mention, I don't have a way to get there without someone taking me. Now all I got to do is concentrate on my SAT coming up on Nov and Dec.</p>

        <p>I've been wanting to add news feeds to my site, but I can't seem to find any clear answers. I'm trying to use RDF-RSS for my news feeds, but I don't know how to program, so nearly all the info I can find on the web is completely useless to me. As my site is completely personal, I can't justify paying for hosting, so I can use scripts on my site. Maybe there is a way to use client-side scripts (?) to do what I want. I have the links that I need to grab the feeds, but I don't know the how to use PHP, ASP, whatevers. Nor do I know if I can use them on this server. Damn programmers and their elitest lingo.</p>
        <p>No!, let us not relinquish our divine knowledge to the infidels. Lest we undermine our superiority and again become social outcast anew. So sayeth the wise uNiXia.</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, I went to the coast (Gulf Shores) last weekend. I got to see my sister, who lives in Greenville, SC, which was quite a treat. "Cruising the Coast" was going on, so I got a unhealthy dose of classic American iron. It was great. I took lots of pictures, and worked on my otherwise imaculate photography skills (not). I'm really starting to hate my current camera, but I'll stick with it a little longer just so I can be sure that It's not me who sucks.</p>
        <p>Other news, from various soures, and shall remain undisclosed in the forseeable future, have reported that Corey is still in his room, hypnotized by the computer screen and otherwise waisting away.</p>
