        <h3 class="title">Intelectual Propery Rights - The Open Source Argument: Is It Valid?</h3>
        <p>With all the fuss about IP rights and abuses, one can be lost in a sea of arguments and litigation. I saw an link to an <a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=02/11/30/050236">article</a> on /. about the role copyright law should have on software code. The author examines the Open Source movement and GNU GLP license schemes and possible impact on future copyright laws. It's an intresting debate, but I'm completely lost as to which way to go.</p>
        <p>Should copyright law be applicable to software? If so, what protections will foster innovation and spur growth without being overly intrusive? Just how much say should an author have in what is done with his "propery". I, like the author, believe that intrusion into the "private shere" will only bring about enraged citizens. And further inhibit constructive mechanisms for protections.</p>
        <p>I believe thats the main reason most people are outraged about the latest efforts by the music industy and hollywood to thwart pirating. I think of it as priciple. I shouldn't be subject to scrutiny and person invasion by these corporations because they hold copyrights. Since when does IP law supercede the right to privacy? So, I see the privacy sphere argument a valid one. Will it win through to the end? No, I think not. The economic argument will win the hearts of our congress. Who seem partial to the belief that a good economy is the heart of America and that what is good for the stock market is good for democracy. On another note, I can't see any way to protect the rights of an author and allow for the privacy of individuals in the digital age. But one thing seems clear: I see why Microsoft has thus far steered clear from the debate. Leaving enforment and regulation to vendors and only providing a frame work ala Palladium.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a> <span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at December 7, 2002 06:38 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=86" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>

        <p>The GNU license specifically states that if you build code based on this code you give it away. Copyrights do apply to software but not if you give it away under GNU. Leave the current system in place. If you want your copyright then stay away from open source and GNU. If you go into open source and GNU then don't whine about not having a copyright.
