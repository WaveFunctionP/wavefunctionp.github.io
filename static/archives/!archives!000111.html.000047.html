        <h3 class="title">The Evolution of Online Media and Democracy</h3>
        <p>The growth of the internet has had an enormous impact on social collaboration. It's seems as if we've only touched the surface. What lies ahead, although unknown, is at once interesting, treacherous, and definitley revolutionary. Here I explore a few ideas on what may come. Just a few of the more surprising results of a pervasive and obiquitous web community. One that transends the computer on which is was built. The very nature and mentality on society at large may see a significant shift in thinking.</p><a name="more" id="more"></a>
        <p>I still find it intriguing to speculate over how the internet will <a href="http://www.praxagora.com/andyo/ar/ip_owners.html">change</a> the way we access information and art. The net has been going for some time, but I think we've yet to harness the full power that open collaboration has to offer. Many people still choose to just read a site's content despite the authors effort to provide and open forum for discussion; even *gasp* here at MCTPhysics. I've had a growing suspicion that this current debate over intellectual property issues will take a more optimistic turn, but I don't think things have gotten as bad as they are going to get. Major IP owners and distributors have yet to use up their substantial power base and I fear that the battle will be long and hard. Only until we've reached the breaking point with Mom and Pop realizing that there favorite media can no longer be used in a fair and reasonable way. They will see that it's a result of heavy handed politics and regulation by their favorite Senator or Congressman with substantial campaign contributions from said entities. I see that as the crucial turning point, and I think we've a way to go before that happens.</p>
        <p>It doesn't stop there though and I'm not sure if sure which will happen first. The next revolution will be collaboration on a whole new level. Many people working on one piece of artwork or music. Books, journals and news papers being published by people by people who've never even met? This already happens on a significant scale already, but I think we've just touched the surface. Government and organizations that are run totally online, but have appreciable influence offline. This is really interesting. Perhaps in the distant future we will have an America that is run totally online with each interest area (economics, foreign policy, local zoning regulations, education) all run, not by a bureaucracy of disinterested political types, but by expert committees and open discussion forums accessible by anyone interested. This is the convergence that I see as the emergence of true democracy, where everyone has a voice and is free to speak it in a proportional manner, and have the same power to change as the next guy. No more will people have to concern themselves with topic that they don't understand if they don't want to, and everyone can be assured of legislation on issues by a true consensus of individuals in their area of expertise.</p>
        <p>At first site this seems site this seems preposterous. Perhaps this is a bit utopian, but if you can believe with me that we do not have a democracy here in America, but some sort of media giant monarchy. Then maybe you can see a need for something new. Maybe this is a back to basics philosophy to go back and revisit the logistical limitations that the Forefathers had when they drafted the Constitution. This won't come about over night, and presumable nowhere in my lifetime, but maybe my children will have the benefit of a more open and socially reflective government. It'll happen in phases. If you listen closely, you can hear the first whispers. The U.S. government is standardizing it's online efforts and you can see the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/23/technology/23NECO.html">beginnings</a> of a collaborative effort in the mandatory forums and feedback systems planned.</p>
        <p>This plan goes beyond any system of online voting, although this is encompassed in its whole. The details are vague and many problems are unforeseeable. Who knows if whether or not our expert system will not be slighted to the views of the population of that interest sector or if it will still reflect and the general opinion of the population at large, given adequate understanding of the issues involved. This system in engendered off the belief that people tend to be compassionate and understanding and appeals directly to our social nature. When dealing with their fellow man., and given the opportunity to see outside themselves to consider the impact of their decisions as an impact on society at large. Not just another insignificant ballot in the box for some politician that they could care less about; never mind not even caring about. In other words, this will depend solely on appealing to the higher values of the human conscience. It's a lofty goal, but after 9/11, one has a hard time deigning that the American heart isn't dead.</p>
        <p>Maybe one day the president will be nothing more than a figure head similar to Britain's Queen. Again all this is speculation, but I'd really like to here your feedback on the comments board.</p><span class="posted">Posted by Der Fuehrer at December 23, 2002 02:36 AM | <a href="/mt/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;entry_id=111" onclick="OpenTrackback(this.href); return false">TrackBack</a><br /></span>
