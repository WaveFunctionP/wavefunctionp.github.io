                        This is a small usability mod for Kerbal Space Program meant to address a small annoyance with the way the game works. It was <a href="https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/SimpleScienceFix">written in C#</a> and uses the Unity Game Engine and Kerbal Space Program APIs.
                    </p>

                        It has been fairly well received with over <a href="http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/230239-simplesciencefix">1,000 downloads</a> since it's release.

                        This is mod for Kerbal Space Program. It is designed to automate some of the more tedious elements of the game play experience. It was <a href="https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/ForScience">written in C#</a> and uses the Unity Game Engine and Kerbal Space Program APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was my first mod that I wrote from scratch. It has been well received with over <a href="http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220264-for-science">15,000 downloads</a> since it was released. It was also <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-kerbal-space-program-mods-2/">featured on PC Gamer</a> as one of "best Kerbal Space Program mods" and has even been forked for expanded applications by other authors.
                    </p>
                    <h5><small>Notable features:</small></h5>
                    <p>The mod detects experiments and locations, performs the available experiments when appropriate, and collects the data to the primary command pod. Having a scientist on board will make resetting run-once experiments automatic. It has purposefully uncomplicated controls, just a simple toggle icon on the tool bar.</p>
                    <p>It is supposed to work like magic, and it does.</p>
                    <h5><small>Technical challenges:</small></h5>
                    <p>Implementing the business logic was made fairly complicated due to the way the API is structured (and partial documentation) as well as due to transient states in the game objects being observed. I have some possible further plans, but I consider this project to be feature complete and in maintenance.</p>

                        This is mod for Kerbal Space Program. It one of the larger types of mods that add new art and game mechanics. It is based on a previous mod called Interstellar, which been abandoned for some time. It was <a href="https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/KSPInterstellar">written in C#</a> and uses the Unity Game Engine and Kerbal Space Program APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was my first mod for KSP and I used it to learn about Unity and C#, which started out as only some minor tweaks. After the original author left, I made a major overhaul of all user interactions with the mod and opened it up more the user modification allowing it to inter operate with other mods. It was extremely well received, and was actually the first time I'd received payment for my software, through a significant number and sum of donations. As I had hoped, it soon saw many users share compatibility mods to allow it to work seamlessly with other mods for the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, shortly after Lite was officially release, the original author came back and made significant changes to the base code, made breaking changes to the community resource initiatives. The splits in the code base and mod community eventually made continued support untenable, and I made the decision to support the current game version, but to retire the mod after the next major game version. The originally author eventually left again, and now Interstellar continues on as another branch by another developer, including many of my ideas, as Interstellar Continued.
                    </p>
                    <h5><small>Notable features:</small></h5>
                    <p>This was a huge mod so it would be impractical to list everything. I opened up the part module attributes for textual modification, which allowed players to share simple textual configurations which would allow the mod to work with various constellations of mods. It was one of the founding mods for CommunityResourcePack, which helped to create a more sane system of resources for mods. There were many user interface and usability fixes, everything from tool tips to part behaviors. There was a massive part re-balancing to diversify part niches and expand vessel design innovation and to better fit the part into the stock game's scale. There was a lot of part pruning and the introduction of size scaling to lessen the memory footprint. And there were updates to the art and code to support emissive textures on radiators. And tons and tons of polish over the base Interstellar.</p>
                    <h5><small>Technical challenges:</small></h5>
                    <p>This was my first time working with a substantial project, and the first time working on someone else code. I had to learn the Unity/KSP APIs, which had spotty documentation, and I learned to test my code throughly because of it despite not being able to run the game in debug or any sort of automated testing. In the process I learn how to use git, interact with users, process issues on GitHub, and publish and promote releases.</p>
