As a child, I was\noften found dabbling with a chemistry set, performing experiments,\nor constructing a fort in the woods.\n\nI've dabbled with computers since a young age. My first computer was\na Tandy 1000sx. I remember playing around with BASIC, copying and\nentering programs in by hand from books we had in the house. Or\nmaking text rpgs with friends in Turbo Pascal.\n\nI played the trumpet in the band in middle school and high school. I\nwas also heavily involved in a frontier historical society called\nFrontier Camping Fellowship, as well as the Royal Rangers through my\nchurch.\n\nI was heavily involved in gaming, in particular, I was a community\nleader/influencer for the rogue class in World of Warcraft. I\nalso helped maintain a tool for the rogue community called\nShadowcraft. I am also a mod developer for Kerbal Space Program.\n\nI have ongoing interests in a variety of topics like aerospace,\nsustainability, vernacular architecture, physics, nanotechnology,\nmedicine, and nutrition. I'm also learning to play guitar.\n\n##About work\n\n![blogimg](images/salty.jpg) \n\nProfessionally, I've worked in network/computer administration in\nthe Marine Corps while I was enlisted.
