{"body":"\nThis weeks video is from the fantastic speaker, Bryan Cantrill. This talk is about the history of virtualization and containers, and ends with a plea to run naked containers to reap the benefits of containerization. It's a bit older now, so the thesis is not as relevant, but it covers the topic so well. That and any talk by Cantrill is always worth a watch.\n\n[![[Run containers on bare metal already!]](https://img.youtube.com/vi/coFIEH3vXPw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coFIEH3vXPw)","staticData":{}}
