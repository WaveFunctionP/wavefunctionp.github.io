I have been looking into performance.</p>
<p>One of the neat things about Gatsby is that it will render your app out staticly and then load the rest of your app after the initial render. There is this interesting optimization you can use with your internal links to benefit from client side routing with Gatsby. I had seen it mentioned in the docs for Gastby, but it didn't click with me at the time. However, I came across a post by <a href="https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com/practical-gatsby-js/">Scott Nonnenberg</a> who mentioned that one can avoid a full refresh of the page by utilizing the Link component provided by Gatsby, as opposed to the regular html anchor tags which I had been using. And finally my nagging question was answered as to why my site didn't feel as snappy as the default starter. Swapping those a tags to Links made a huge difference because now each route uses cached resources lazyloaded by Gastby. Awesome Sauce!</p>
<p>With that handled I put my efforts on optimizing loading speed for the initial render. I knew that most people would be hitting my landing page first so I might as well start there. I first headed off to <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a>, which is a tool offered by Google to analyze page performance. There are many other similar tools, but this one was pretty straitforward, and since I have no preference so I just went with it.</p>
<p><img src="/initial-report-e76ffebab587c5ca8bbb6bc5f3d7b8c8.png" alt="A sample report from google after a little optimization"></p>
<p>One of the messages was that the lightbulb 'hero image' on the landing page which I had been using was 4.3MB. which is obviously a lot to be loading on the inital render. And a general first approximation for improving perforamce is simply doing less work. And downloading a smaller file definitely is less work. I played with it a bit, but Google kept wanting a smaller image. And I'll admit I was afraid of ending up with a very weak image with high compression. I put the image through gimp and set the output to 80% quality and reducing the resolution to 1920x1080. Turns out it looks fine even at 1080 on my monitor. I ended up at 109kb, which is pretty good IMO.</p>
<p>The blocking resources will have to wait for now, until I can get rid of the dependancy on Bootstrap. And I'm honestly not too worried about the caching thing. I plan on uploading every week, and it is currently at ten days. I don't expect there will be that many repeat visitors anyway. Let's be honest. I basicly talking to the void here. :P</p></div><small data-reactid="38">Thursday, Dec. 21st, 2017</small><h1 class="text-center page-header" data-reactid="39"></h1></div><div class="row" data-reactid="40"><h2 class="page-header" data-reactid="41"><a href="/first-post/" data-reactid="42">First!</a></h2><div data-reactid="43"><p>Wow! I haven't blogged in years. Since about 2005, I believe. My old blog is now long gone. Maybe one day I'll resurect those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://mctphysics.com/">old posts</a> from the internet archives. Not that I think there is much value in it. However, I do believe it has posts about my first attempts at javascript. Who knows.</p>
<p>I have completed the transition of my blog over to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>. One of the reasons I chose Gastby is that I can use my normal React workflow, but it will also staticly render all the assets for very fast load times. I had been using manual html files with html imports to handle things like headers and templating. While HTML imports worked fine for the most part, I just couldn't see myself doing much more than a very basic website with it. It doesn't seem like HTML imports is really going to catch on any way (probably for good reason).</p>
<p>I knew that I didn't want to tie myself to Wordpress, which would have required me to get a domain name or link away from my GitHub profile page. Nevermind the issues with security. And if I was going to go with a server rendered site, it would probably be ASP.net on Azure. There is also <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (I misspell it every time it seems), which is what <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">GitHub Pages</a> recommends, but I didn't want to hitch myself to the Ruby wagon. I already have enough tools to keep track of.</p>
<p>But Gatsby...Gatsby has worked like a charm. I am very happy with the results so far. I am hopeful that this will work out in the longer term. I've had tremendous fun putting it together. And maybe this can be an outlet for my many random rants instead of them being squirreled away in random social media posts.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p></div><small data-reactid="44">Wednesday, Dec. 13th, 2017</small><h1 class="text-center page-header" data-reactid="45"></h1></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js" integrity="sha256-cCueBR6CsyA4/9szpPfrX3s49M9vUU5BgtiJj06wt/s=" crossorigin="anonymous" data-reactid="46"></script><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa" crossorigin="anonymous" data-reactid="47"></script></div></div><script>
