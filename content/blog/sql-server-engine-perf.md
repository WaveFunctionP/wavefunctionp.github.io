I already share a semi-regular weekly video/talk to my work's chat channel. I think I'm going to start doing so here as well so that it is easier to reference later.

This week is about how sql server works, and some ideas about optimization using that understanding. I believe this should be fairly generalizable, and not just MS SQL Server specific.
